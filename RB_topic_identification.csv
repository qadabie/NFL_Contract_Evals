Melvin Gordon,"Angular, talented open-field runner who combines outstanding burst with a long stride to gain separation and hit the home run. He won't be able to outrun NFL defenders like he did in college and must develop more feel between the tackles. Gordon shines when his track runs over tackle or around the end and can put a defense to sleep around the corner. Not trustworthy enough to be a three-down back, but his pass-catching improved enough to utilize him out of backfield as a receiver. Tall, leggy running back with shredded physique. Transitions run from inside to outside without losing any speed. Can cover five yards in two strides when fully unlocked in open field. Impressive 20-yard burst, creating space to hit the big runs. Averaged 7.6 yards per carry over last two seasons. Had 40 runs for 15-plus yards in 2014. Shifty in open field without having to hesitate. Uses jump-cut at line of scrimmage to change gaps and avoid tacklers. Has an effective spin move to make defenders miss in open field. Great agility and plus balance hurdling opponents diving at his legs. Feet keep moving in tight spaces, probing for daylight. Able to consistently beat college defenders to flank. Loves to run over the tackles. Shows ability to create for himself and has burst and agility to turn small gain into big one. Improved as a pass-catcher over second half of the 2014 season. Desires to bounce runs wide too often. Not as trusting of blocking from B-gap to B-gap. Held to ""stuffs"" -- runs resulting in no yards or a loss -- on 19.2 percent of his carries. Feel and instincts as interior runner need improvement. Shows indecisiveness as one-cut runner. Would gear down and stutter-step to line, waiting for crease to show itself rather than adjusting on fly and taking what was available. Play strength through hole was only average. Used speed over strength to create many missed or broken tackles. Benefited from gaping running lanes. Ball security was an issue. Fumbled six times over his final five games, often being stripped while finishing run. Uncomfortable pass-catcher with marginal hands. Either dropped, double caught or smothered many throws. Pass protection needs work. Might have to come off field on third downs.",-0.06229337069830082,0.012951596139449125,0.0,-0.08738750156491573,-0.011878968655754416,-0.017044039852504692,-0.011723604628203418,-0.06585079875576957,-0.0914129636938032,-0.03205466632686581
Todd Gurley,"The rehab work and NFL Scouting Combine medicals will be extremely important for Gurley's draft stock as teams assess his potential durability as an NFL running back. He played less than 40 percent of his team's offensive snaps over the last three years, so there is plenty of tread still on the tires. Has the talent to be a top-five NFL running back, but ACL tear clouds the short-term picture. Rare blend of speed and power. Immense power in legs and shows balance through contact. Shreds arm tackles and has speed to house it. Very hard to tackle on an angle. Professional, decisive runner. Presses line of scrimmage to set up his cut-back runs. Gets downhill with knee bend and forward lean, staying small through the hole. Uses quick, tight steps to second level. Will sink and explode into tackler or side-step and jet, causing hesitation in downhill safeties with their approach. Converts ""speed to power"" between tackles and around corner. Rarely looks to run out of bounds and finishes his runs. Able to factor out of the backfield with soft hands and ability to adjust to throws. In 2014, churned out an amazing 61.9 percent of his rushing yardage after contact. Strong hands and carries ball tight to his body. Only three fumbles in 510 carries. Missed three games in 2013 due to ankle injury and tore his ACL in 2014. Questions about whether he'll return back to his play speed are a big concern. Vision is average. Still gaining feel as a zone runner. Too locked into looking for cutback lanes when play-side run is open. Can get better at setting up blockers in space. Average creativity in tight quarters. Patience and tempo as a runner can improve. Quick passing attack limited his protection opportunities but was very average when given the shot.",-0.11369870514879721,-0.040401583589826456,-0.1025694244906981,-0.034443854903660046,0.048379686892624146,-0.00558736307423615,0.040280787331953366,0.007962219619997596,-0.005438323290855827,-0.01748456389940712
Tevin Coleman,"His violent running style is a joy to watch, but might have to be tempered to extend his career. He is a ""race car in the red"" on just about every snap and refuses to give in, which leads to many big runs. Zone, gap, power ... it doesn't really matter because Coleman can fit all schemes. Has the burst and top-end speed to be a game-changing running back for a team looking for a workhorse. Decisive north-south runner. Outstanding three-step burst into second level. Fearless between the tackles. Has dangerous jump-cut to instantly change gaps and ruin the plans of linebackers. Stays square to the line and is always in ready position to hit turbo. Fluid and flexible lower body with elite one-cut ability and natural change-of-direction talent without gearing down. Power in legs to slice through arm tackles and uses free hand as quality stiff-arm. Violent run finisher. Will duck shoulder and throw heavy forearm into tackler to prove a point. Not a content runner -- keeps feet moving after contact and won't give in. Capable hands out of backfield and willing to square up and engage pass rushers on pass plays. Hits top speed so quickly that safeties and linebackers repeatedly take poor angles, leading to long touchdowns. Half of his 28 career rushing touchdowns were of 43-plus yards, including eight of 64-plus yards. Treats every carry like a sprint. Must improve run tempo and patience on stretch plays. Has to learn when to keep run play-side and improve patience so he allows back-side cutback lanes to develop. Can improve out of backfield. Wasn't always in position to scan defense on screen passes, resulting in lost yardage. Pad level often a little high into contact.",0.06939345104474307,-0.07844742353237436,-0.02843188923993438,0.0,0.05347164192052274,-0.049967154421036955,-0.013234506144283373,-0.060517250446785235,-0.07570472601996754,-0.06809927023895494
Ameer Abdullah,"Despite having first-round talent, Abdullah's lack of preferred NFL size and issues with ball security might cause some teams to shy away from him in the opening round. Abdullah has explosive potential as a runner and ball-catcher and is a natural zone-scheme fit. His high character will make him a hit during interview process. Decisive runner with good lower-body drive and a willingness to run behind his pads. Finishes his runs. Has NFL-caliber burst and can hit top speed quickly. Defenses must respect his ability to turn the corner on play-side. Patient runner with plus vision. Willing to seek out cutback lanes. Rarely dances to the line or makes unnecessary lateral moves. Isn't a predictable runner. Lacks blazing top-end speed but plays fast. Highly competitive with a high football IQ. Hasn't dropped a pass in two years and can be a valuable weapon in passing attack. Will make arm tacklers pay and is better in short yardage than most backs his size. Can help immediately as a punt or kick returner. Personal and football character is considered off-the-charts by the scouting community. Lacks ideal size that teams look for from a three-down running back. Frame is close to maxed out. Doesn't always go through his pass routes at full speed. Smallish frame causes some issues in pass protection. Tenacity in protection needs to improve. Ball security is a legitimate concern with 13 fumbles over his four years at Nebraska.",0.1544913496865114,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.0007948931120674227,0.01835801073120414,0.0287888077554564,-0.14354090058868207,-0.04623878854835813,-0.07350761656412894
Jay Ajayi,"While the comparison to Marshawn Lynch might be a little much considering Lynch's exploits in the NFL, Ajayi's running style and body type are very similar to Lynch's and Ajayi features an improving stiff arm and physicality that has become Lynch's calling card. Ajayi has the ability to play all three downs while mashing in short yardage and near the goal line. Scouts have been quietly circling Ajayi as a second-tier running back who offers tremendous value on the second day (Rounds 2-3) of the draft. Good size and great feet. Former soccer player with sudden feet. Able to string together multiple moves at a time. Varies speeds as a runner and can call on second gear when he sees daylight. Hips and feet always in sync thanks to soccer background. Shows enough wiggle to make defenders miss and can create and improvise if creases aren't offering much. Runs with wide base and generates leg drive to push. Plays with bend and bursts through the hole with low pad level. Reliable yards-after-contact back. Accelerates into contact on second level. True weapon out of backfield with adequate hands and good feel for maximizing each catch in space. Twists and turns and fights to fall forward. Asked to be physical, downhill runner between tackles and he obliged. Shows good blitz recognition. Showed mental toughness and character, coming back from deep in the doghouse for October 2011 arrest. Gets too cute at times looking to sift laterally from gap to gap as he approaches line of scrimmage. Needs to run with more urgency to perimeter. Can get out-flanked when opportunity to turn corner was previously available. Average feel through the hole. Runs into defenders he should be able to avoid. Heavy workload in 2014 with 398 total touches (28.4 per game). Ball-security concerns with 11 fumbles over last 597 carries. Pass-protection technique needs improvement. Tore his ACL in 2011. Was arrested for stealing sweatpants in 2011 and faced long road of severe punishment from then-coach Chris Petersen.",0.2190070154409296,-0.03818408350527338,-0.07206776430751283,-0.011053534123730127,-0.030954896734410722,-0.06902871352629461,0.0,-0.07873693544808155,0.004513527132236746,-0.026310033489222583
Duke Johnson,"One of the most explosive runners in college football during his time at Miami, Johnson doesn't need much of a crease to make defenses pay. His explosive quickness and elusiveness should help him adapt quickly to NFL speed and his feel and courage as a one-cut runner should earn him instant playing time. Johnson's lack of protection skills and his injury concerns could force him into a committee situation. Explosive burst and plays with suddenness. Elusive in tight quarters. Has lightning in his feet. Has hips and feet to stop and start without stalling. Rare ability on stretch plays to hit cutback lanes that other backs can't get to. Runs with patience and a well-timed burst. Has great feel as zone-scheme, one-cut runner. Changes direction without breaking stride. Courageous runner. Shows no fear when getting downhill. Strong-willed competitor with toughness. Has second gear around the corner and can erase the angles. Gets small(er) through the hole and runs behind pads. Fights through arm tackles. Regroups and balances himself after initial contact. Reads and sets up routes and adjusts to poorly thrown balls. Average inside runner, where feel and instincts are concerned. Vision fails him at times when running between the tackles. Won't always see initial hole and will mash turbo button, hoping to power through to second level. At times unwilling to do dirty work in pass protection. Looks for cut blocks rather than squaring up and playing with technique and toughness. Tries to run to daylight once in open field rather than just finishing runs. Hampered by injuries in 2014 and broke his ankle in 2013. Medicals will be combed over. Must improve ball security after fumbling six times over last two seasons.",-0.12091265482864261,0.0,-0.05389183894874021,-0.019805040260267723,0.04455180655949868,-0.07116804593065179,0.018162888866464832,-0.048071884862930424,-0.0406833811837468,-0.06362859517392007
T.J. Yeldon,"Instinctive, athletic running back who has the foot quickness to create for himself when lanes constrict or blocks are missed. Yeldon lacks the ball security, top-end speed and desired tackle breaking to be a full-time starter. He's a versatile, rotational back with the ability to step in and step up. Has good size with room on his frame to add more bulk. Exceptional hips and foot quickness, using both to weave and dart through the trash between tackles. Quick, decisive reads on zone plays. Has ankle flexion to dip, one-cut and burst through second level and into the third. Creative runner showing innate feel for running lanes. Anticipates creases that are developing and makes himself skinny to squeeze through. Effortless lateral movement. Can make tacklers miss and change tackle angles in confined quarters. Above average out of backfield and after the catch. Productive when playing through pain. Upright runner in space, opening himself and the ball up to big hits. Pad level too high at point of collision. Mediocre power for size. Doesn't push the pile and won't run through many tackles. Pass protection lacking. Throws shoulder at pass rusher rather than squaring up and taking on with good posture. Tends to bounce and juke a little too long at the second level. Must improve ball security after fumbling 10 times over 576 career carries.",0.026534860895859526,-0.02486625432479007,-0.04428860299351247,0.0,-0.0287113883395136,0.0,-0.051294936965101776,-0.027396184641660926,-0.11559052064162689,0.0
Cameron Artis-Payne,"Doesn't have much tread off the tires since arriving to Auburn from junior college. Has proven that he can hit the turbo button and get through creases, but lacks special traits and ability to max out carries. Artis-Payne is a tough runner but I question if he has enough athleticism to be anything more than a grinder and average backup. Patient runner who waits for blocks to develop before attacking the hole. Will duck his head and finish a run. Short-stepper who gets to top speed quickly. Looks to keep the runs north and south. Effective spin move on second level. Good ball security. Due to stocky frame, defenders underestimate his burst around the corner and tend to take poor angles on him. Willing banger between tackles. Patience sometimes turns into a lack of urgency with reads. Thickly built but doesn't move piles as often as expected. One note runner. Tight hips and without much wiggle in open space. Must improve in protection. Might not have enough juice to be able to threaten the edge as an NFL runner.",0.03827880314664754,-0.016499810151451147,0.06711589014693682,0.0,-0.03152284250315933,-0.023970712949707627,0.0,0.05807313944861468,-0.01906399589917172,0.03874487913565171
David Cobb,"Cobb's YouTube highlights might bore you, but he's custom-made for physical running teams. He has one-cut traits and can play in a gap scheme. Adjusting his style to the speed of the NFL game might take some time, but Cobb's downhill, run-finishing style fits what running games are becoming again and he has a shot to be more than just a complementary back. Powerful, compact runner with a low center of gravity. Efficient and decisive. Makes defenders miss with slight movement and hand usage. Won't succumb to arm tackles. Gained 54 percent of his yardage after contact from 2013-2014. Patient runner who gets the most from his runs. Has good speed in open field for a back his size. Balance is his friend. Smooth change-of-direction with little wasted motion. Gets low and finishes with leg drive. When he smells the end zone, he wants to eat. Average improviser. Not a stop/start runner and lacks dynamic qualities. Gets yards on his plate and what he grinds for after contact. Lacks lateral quickness to bounce runs outside with consistent success in the NFL. Fumbled in four of six games in the middle of the 2014 season. Needs more commitment to pass protection. Average hands as a receiver. Needs extended runway to ramp up to top speed.",0.02662978733437315,-0.03563441281334755,0.08593597434712559,0.0,0.010408770475326082,-0.07055521063509457,0.008664618223646139,0.0,0.05476208856425454,-0.020664151863218218
Mike Davis,"Rhythm runner who is at his best when he's getting plenty of work. Davis has a surprising ability to turn on the jets and get on top of the secondary quickly for long runs, and his north-south mentality is a fit for the pros. With an ability to play on third down as well, the only thing holding Davis back is conditioning. Davis won't make too many defenders miss, so he can't afford to lose the corner speed he showed in 2013. Davis can be a very capable NFL backup with the potential to become a starter. Compact frame with plus balance as a runner. Keeps feet moving in traffic and can pinball from defender to defender. Uses spin move effectively to avoid the hit and keep running. Will duck head and accelerate behind his pads with force to finish his runs. Downhill runner near the end zone with adequate push to grind out the extra half yard needed. Creates separation to the perimeter with quality stiff arm and showed surprising top-end speed to hit the long run in 2013. Gets adequate separation out of backfield and can convert the catch into a first down. Capable in pass protection with understanding of protections. Has some hip tightness, which limits his lateral movement. Won't make defender miss with wiggle or juke, and struggles to create when his track is closed. Will duck his head prematurely heading into hole at times, and briefly loses his vision and feel for the hole, often running into the backs of blockers. Showed substantially more juice as a runner in 2013. Conditioning looked off and he was sluggish to the perimeter and through the line of scrimmage in 2014. Relatively ineffective toward end of the year. The 2014 tape shows energy lacking for Davis compared to 2013.",0.08539961503901738,0.01204448574635462,-0.035037870340452526,0.008175421221358743,-0.02995734102263839,-0.040126211515260454,0.0,-0.02536939982761577,0.0,0.033539723901733445
Javorius Allen,"Workhorse back able to make plays late in the game and work out of the backfield to keep defenses honest. His relative elusiveness in space and ability to cut on a dime give him the ability to create yards where there are none, but his average vision and inability to finish off runs will keep him from getting some of the yards teams might expect. He's well-rounded enough to be a very good backup with middle-
of-the-road starting potential. Loose hips for tight turns and razor-sharp cuts. Has quick-stop, jump-cut ability to make defenders miss in the backfield. Can slalom back and forth, navigating around traffic through the line of scrimmage and into the second level. Able to shake linebackers and downhill safeties in space. Short-area acceleration to give leg-tacklers a vanishing target. Has lateral quickness to bounce runs outside and create something out of nothing. Factors into passing game, averaging 11.3 yards per catch over last two seasons. Plays with adequate burst through the crease. Able to handle a heavy workload if asked. Running style doesn't match his size. Upright runner. Plays with high pad level and doesn't finish runs with attitude and urgency. Slows feet into contact and rarely explodes through initial tackler with force. Lacks instincts and feel for developing running lanes. Chooses the trafficked path more than expected. At times, will show some indecisiveness and hesitation into the fray. Will break prematurely from path the play should follow rather than allowing it to develop. Focus drops plagued him out of backfield in 2014.",-0.11776570106046445,0.0,-0.07131402581643531,-0.036877465610937854,0.0,-0.03990565914063164,0.04470239271449672,0.027033971291856092,-0.03815162936145664,0.009570332987483724
David Johnson,"Johnson lacks the short-area quickness to be a consistently effective every-down running back, but he has good size, speed and hands so he can't just be dismissed. He doesn't run routes well enough and isn't sudden enough to be a wide receiver, so he might have to be a third-down back with kick-return potential. Looks good on the hoof. Possesses a big body and falls forward for additional yards. Smooth pass-catcher out of the backfield and is a mismatch for linebackers. Has been a consistent weapon out of the backfield while in college. Uses an effective jump cut on inside runs to change direction and can string a couple of them together on the same run. Has good long speed when he gets into space. Long-strider. Doesn't always look like he has the foot quickness to burst through the hole consistently. Allows defenders to get a hand on him through the replace and isn't a classic finisher. Tends to hit the brakes too hard in order to make his cuts. Questionable vision. Looks to make cuts instead of keeping the run play-side. Scouts want to see more fire in his play demeanor. Play strength and blocking are problems. Goes down too easily.",0.06434666554595289,0.04690630616267842,0.028242227447110895,-0.03938636493159566,0.0,-0.03530854020920923,0.04348603951894289,0.001503961473039668,0.0,0.006184521906089521
Matt Jones,"Has very good athleticism for a big running back and is a physical pile-mover who is difficult to stop for negative yardage. Unfortunately, Jones lacks the instincts and vision to fully maximize his physical tools. Jones could become the physical member of a running-back-by-committee approach, with upside as a third-down option. Imposing size with muscular frame. Above-average swivel in hips and perimeter quickness for runner his size. Pistons for feet, chomping and churning through contact to extend run. Has slippery lower body with angle-tackle attempts sliding off. Keeps shoulders square to line for maximum power. Plays with forward lean and is difficult to stop for a loss. Used sparingly as a pass-catcher, but flashes capable hands if asked to do so in the pros. Aggressive in protection, squaring up and striking a blow against free-running blitzer. More grinder than every-down running back. Will hit it downhill, but has very little feel for maximizing run creases. Blind to open running lanes. Drops head and burrows into blockers and defenders rather than seeing open space. Must improve patience in setting up blocks. Can juke and shift when headed to line of scrimmage, but doesn't show much creativity and shiftiness once he's on second level. Needs to keep ball tucked and secured to avoid fumbling issues.",-0.12563471738566692,-0.0014171365796544835,0.046856196053414914,0.0,0.01899036281394187,-0.06707715783106541,0.0,0.0,-0.13896835079302566,0.0
Jeremy Langford,"Langford showed improvement from 2013 to 2014, but he doesn't accelerate through contact and will usually get what is blocked. Without an ability to maximize his yards with each carry, teams could peg him as a ""committee back"" with an ability to play on third downs. Running back who has played wide receiver and cornerback at Michigan State. Improved a great deal since 2013 season. Has feet to avoid the trash and bounce it outside. Has burst around the corner and can separate from linebackers in pursuit. Finished his 2014 campaign with 22 carries of 15-plus yards, placing him fifth in running-back heavy Big Ten. Effective with chip blocks and will square up blitzers and take them on in pass protection. Has blocking and pass-catching talent to play on third downs. Good spin move and plus lateral foot quickness. Maintains balance through contact. Showed special-teams potential as a sophomore. Not a physical runner. Broke very few tackles this year and churned out pedestrian yards after contact. Gains extra yards by sliding laterally out of tackles rather than leg churn. Lacks commitment between the tackles. Seems content to absorb hits rather than dish them out. Scouts believe he will be a ""bouncer"" in pros, looking to take runs outside prematurely. Has burst, but not as much wiggle as anticipated.",-0.16957056380989585,-0.09948706942989831,0.0,-0.021856067248729554,0.03870010162562566,-0.02337485826413968,-0.038093607205100945,-0.0843975376523059,-0.02464842684653486,0.06746793535708896
Marcus Murphy,"All-purpose running back with a lean frame and a big heart. Showed consistency of effort and production during his time at Missouri. His value as a runner is limited due to his size, but he has the potential to become a legitimate target out of the backfield and might warrant some reps in camp as a slot receiver. Murphy can step in and immediately challenge for the top spot as a kickoff and/or punt returner. Has the foot quickness and acceleration to make something out of nothing when called upon as a runner. Needs to play in space, but has quality traits for a runner, despite size. Has enough speed to turn the corner and hit a big run down the sideline. In passing game, mismatches inside 'backers with razor-sharp cuts to the sideline, creating easy throws for the quarterback. Looks to adjust his routes over the top of coverage if quarterback scrambles. Has excellent hands and concentration to finish a catch despite impending contact. Celebrated kick- and punt-return specialist with seven career return touchdowns at Missouri. Needs to improve his reads and feel on stretch plays flowing outside. Small running back with limited amount of carries he can offer in a given game. Tends to float in space as a receiver rather than working back to the ball. Doesn't make the sharp, downhill cuts expected from him as a running back. Missed 2011 with a shoulder injury. He tries to get in the way as a pass blocker, but lacks bulk and strength to be trusted with blitz pickup on next level.",-0.20481159137108382,-0.03243495202259973,-0.024140081527117566,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018293310339387452,-0.05253473794008369,0.08343188396179999
Karlos Williams,"Williams is a big, talented athlete who is still finding his way as a running back. He seemed almost content to lose his job in 2014 and teams will be turning over every rock looking for information on his character. As a one-cut runner with exceptional burst and rare physical traits, Williams could become a very good starter in a zone-based scheme, but his floor is very low based on character and scheme fit. Former safety with aggressive, physical temperament. Taller and longer than most running backs, but has exceptional burst to trim the corner and go. Angular running style. Makes subtle changes of direction without gearing down. One-cut daddy on outside zone plays. Has good top-end speed. Can be a factor on swing passes and will body up in pass protection. Lowers pads and delivers a blow on the move. Falls forward and is a pile mover when pad level is right. Natural footwork for an inexperienced back. Slams it between tackles when asked and doesn't look to bounce outside. Shows patience and uses head fakes to freeze defenders in space. Hard to tackle and keeps feet churning at impact. Upright runner. Has issues playing with leverage when challenged suddenly in the hole. Needs to see contact coming to get pads low enough. Has just two years of running back experience. Instincts and feel are very hit and miss. Runs himself into trouble and might not fit all running schemes. Doesn't make many defenders miss on second level. ""Explosive Rushes"" (15-plus yards) fell off substantially in 2014. Gained additional weight preseason, which appears to have slowed him. Lost starting job to freshman. Was investigated by Tallahassee police in domestic battery case, but no charges were filed.

Josh Robinson,"Compact running back with squatty lower body and a short-striding style that allows him to get to his top speed quickly in the open field. Robinson appears to be lacking an NFL burst and the shiftiness needed to create more yardage for himself on the second level. He has good short-area footwork and is effective as a pass-catcher but is lacking a differentiating talent from the rest of the backs in this draft. Built low to the ground with power trunk and thick bubble. Coils into a ball at contact, making him immune to shoulder and/or forearm blows to tackle. Patient runner. Runs with consistent balance and can maintain it through contact. Flashes lateral agility to escape from the side door and bounce a run wide. Steady threat out of the backfield as pass-catcher. Soft hands to secure the throw and is ready to run after catch. Can chop pass rusher down with his cut blocks. Vision is average to below average, and will leave some yards on the field. Gets what is blocked and relies on his short-area footwork to make tacklers miss rather than true elusiveness in open area. One-note runner with tightly bundled hips and marginal athleticism. Nothing special with burst through hole, as defenders frequently get their hands on him to slow his progress. Benefited from zone-read system with dual-threat quarterback creating consistent running lanes over tackle. Feet barely leave ground, opening Robinson up to ankle tackles.",0.17803096335563634,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021478600822772947,0.0,-0.10334959856839696,0.0,-0.010513255950628266,0.058613960947006945
Kenny Hilliard,Lacks elusiveness and doesn't carry enough power behind his pads to create any intrigue. Couldn't even get to 100 carries in a single season while in college and unlikely to be able to break into rotation in the pros. Decent top-end speed and can catch the ball well out of the backfield. Finds open spaces in passing game and sets up blocks after the catch. Doesn't dance to the line and finishes off runs falling forward. Play speed is adequate but could improve if carrying less weight. Doesn't show feel to create if initial running lane is restricted. Burst is absent out of breaks or cuts. Can't shake defender on second level or in open space. Isn't very difficult to bring down for a back his size. Effort to fool defense on play fakes is substandard. Poor technique in pass protection -- lunger with ducked head.,-0.11677256838313033,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.03309113868137176,-0.03880392388162825,0.0068092839073651545,-0.027145575512829586,0.0,0.0
Joey Iosefa,"One-speed running back with some weight behind his pads, but not enough explosive power to offset his lack of burst and overall athleticism. Could struggle to find a home as an NFL running back and might need to take a look at playing fullback. No-nonsense runner who prefers to rush between the tackles. Will coil his hips and deliver a blow into second-level linebackers attempting to tackle him and pass rushers in pass protection. Often leans shoulder into contact, absorbing blow while resetting feet to continue his run. Functional ability to cut and take it downhill. Can catch the ball out of the backfield and is adequate in pass protection. Bulky, but unathletic build. Shows below-average foot quickness, which limits ability to run to perimeter and to make defenders miss in space. Has marginal burst through line of scrimmage, forcing him to deal with consistent traffic around him. Doesn't possess ground-floor acceleration or wiggle to make consistent yardage in screen game.",-0.07029213891727537,0.0,-0.04350175996171211,0.0,-0.007232455608932407,-0.08297439603277275,-0.05662792458247292,-0.00742409074507833,0.045760458352534554,0.0
Ezekiel Elliott,"Elite, three­-down running back who has the ability to excel in every facet of the game. Elliott has rare combination of size, athleticism, pass-catching and blocking skills and his competitive nature is always bubbling on the surface. While he's had to handle a heavy workload over the last two seasons, Elliot should still come out of the gates as one of the most productive young running backs in the league. Elite combination of vision and decisiveness. Instinctive, short strider with instant reaction time. Has a bona fide jump-­cut to elude penetration in the backfield and enough burst to elude chasers when he bounces runs to the outside. Able to change directions with no hesitation or wasted motion and is always headed forward. Has innate feel for developing blocks in space and is excellent at setting his blocks up and accelerating from behind them when the linebacker is trapped. When it's gridlocked inside, finds yards on his own. Rocked up physique but still maintains loose hips for agility. Exceptional balance through contact and takes tacklers for a ride. Has a ""come at me, bro!"" mentality as a runner. Loves to end runs on his physical terms. Uses lead shoulder as a weapon, but plays with outstanding ball security. Looks to absolutely bludgeon defenders as a lead blocker and is often successful. Able pass catcher who adjusts to throws and can do something with it after the catch. Strapped it up with a heavy workload over last two seasons including over 600 touches. Defenders land big shots on him. Appears to be too willing to put himself through the meat grinder rather than avoiding certain collisions. Understanding when to attack and when to elude may take time for him. Can sharpen his pass routes a bit and has room for improvement as a pass blocker. On second level, gets on top of defenders before he has a chance to gather himself into a position to evade a tackle.

Derrick Henry,"Bell-cow running back with an ability to strap on feedbag and eat for four quarters. Henry's long legs and angular running style is a much better fit for downhill running teams who value lead backs and physicality. Henry needs early running room as he's not a creator in the backfield, but once he gets up a full head of steam, he is a nightmare with his ability to punish on the second and third level or take it to the house. Henry should come in and provide immediate production as a starter. One of the biggest running backs you will ever see. Can be a violent runner without even trying. Pummels tacklers with forward lean and dynamite behind his pads. Gives run-­support cornerbacks bad dreams. Rare top­-end speed for a runner his size. Long strides from second to third level cut into reaction time for safeties and often leave them a step short and grasping for air. Effective in zone, gap and power schemes. Rarely fatigues and wears down defenses as game goes on. Had 29.6 percent of his explosive carries come in the fourth quarter. Makes consistent, initial reads as a zone runner. Against 
Mississippi State, took outside zone run and cut it all the way back across formation out­racing defense for 65-yard touchdown. Led nation in missed tackles forced with 60. Uses subtle change of direction on the second level  while keeping runs north/south. Used as a possession bully in short yardage spots and when Alabama wanted to impose their will. With almost 400 touches this year, scouts are concerned about his workload. Averaged almost 32 carries against SEC competition including 90 carries over his final two regular season games. Tall, long-strider who takes time to build up his speed. Average foot quickness can lead to tackles for losses if he gets too cute in the backfield. Needs to improve his second read as a zone runner. Ineffective in passing game with below average hands. Narrow based running style allows defenders to trip him up. More run­-finisher 
than tackle breaker with just seven broken tackles to Leonard Fournette's 22. Sluggish cut­back ability once he's outside the tackle box.",0.0761010684853378,0.0,-0.09875715421732865,-0.027117707753629577,-0.006058629505733361,-0.07906280477207503,-0.024302600392017665,0.0,-0.0376563118480812,-0.03285645638815335
Jordan Howard,"Howard has the optimal size and talent needed to strap the pads on and become a productive workhorse for a team looking for one, true lead back. Howard's vision, power and subtle shiftiness allow him to create and break tackles along the way. Staying healthy in the NFL is a legitimate concern for Howard considering his relentless running style. If he can stay healthy, Howard has the ability to become an instant factor as an NFL starter. Showed ability to step his game up against top competition at both UAB and Indiana. Rushed for at least 145 yards in every full game he played. Natural runner who combines tempo with a special feel for spacial relationships. Pro­-ready vision gives him outstanding feel for run lane developments at the line of scrimmage and onto the second level. Consistently chooses best angles and creases for optimal yardage. For a big back, can make himself skinny through tight quarters. Decisive and punishing. Drops pads and accelerates into contact to batter would-­be tacklers on the second and third levels. Drives legs through arm tackles and goes about his work. Hard-­charging when it’s third- or fourth-and-short. Showed potential in screen game as receiver. Doesn't have sudden one-­cut ability and has to tap brakes to hit it downhill on outside zone runs. One-speed runner. Can be chased down by backside sprinters before getting to the second level. Takes big hits due to bruising running style. Scouts concerned about ability to stay healthy. Missed four games and parts of three others with knee and ankle injuries. Upright pads and narrow base leads to slips and balance issues when trying to make sharp cuts. Rarely factored into passing game at UAB or Indiana.",-0.029118588301025653,0.0,-0.12363236002087581,0.007470362455401475,0.0,-0.058952917521932095,-0.02693278254199453,0.04846092005625575,0.0,-0.00743503080873074
Devontae Booker,"Rhythm runner who has experience in a pro­-style running game and who gets better with the more carries he has. Booker is a three-down running back who has the toughness and determination to grind out short yardage while possessing the vision and footwork to create for himself when near the line of scrimmage or the second level. Booker isn’t fast, but he plays at a consistent speed and should have enough quickness to be consistently productive as an NFL starting running back. Patient runner but decisive when he sees the crease. Hits it through the crease with determination. Flashes above-average feel for the way running lanes shift and change, and he flows with it making the smart choices to avoid tacklers and extend runs. Features excellent vision. Doesn’t get caught dancing very often and usually ends the run on his terms with low pads and forward lean. Can maintain play speed when changing direction and cutting. Has crisp footwork approaching the line of scrimmage and can dodge and dart around penetration to create yardage opportunities. Elusive second-level runner able to string together a slew of moves in succession. Effective pass catcher with soft hands. Rarely leaves the field. Dependable short yardage back in college. Willing to step up and do his part in pass protection. Doesn’t have the top­-end speed to be a “chunk play” runner. Full­-time running back, but on the borderline of size NFL teams look for from a full-­time back. May not be able to add more weight onto his frame without compromising quickness and his average speed. Cut down on his fumbles this season but had six last year which could be a potential concern at the NFL level. His 12­-yard runs could become 4-­yard runs thanks to average get­away speed.",0.15796514272968817,0.0,0.04939063426161187,0.0,0.0896622477128475,-0.00893689606462719,-0.006530250320519723,-0.03509179680717176,0.01848798313596705,0.051925103270982896
Alex Collins,"Collins is the epitome of consistency rushing for over 1,000 yards and at least 5.4 yards per carry in each of his three seasons. Vision and footwork are the catalysts for his elusiveness and he has flashed long speed. Collins is a repetitive runner lacking dynamic talent, but he's run in gap, power and zone schemes and should be a scheme fit for most teams looking at running back. Collins should be able to step right in and challenge for carries and red zone work immediately. Well-built, durable frame with feet from a wind­up toy. Plays with amazingly consistent and repetitive tempo as a runner. Able to weave in, out and around traffic without breaking his speed or tempo. Has foot quickness and agility to avoid the backfield traffic and the instant acceleration to get the run back underway. Patient and probing while waiting for a crease. Pad level and knee bend are outstanding. Keeps shoulders square to the line and stays low and tight through the hole. Excellent vision on the interior and consistently jukes and side­steps tackle attempts to create additional yardage. Touchdown hog. Plated 32 rushing touchdowns over last three years. Runs with consistent forward lean and always falls forward. One speed runner. Doesn't play with natural one-­cut stride length and everything comes off stutter-stepping, choppy strides. Feel for outside runs is off. Breaks runs back inside prematurely that still have life along their original track. Can't generate enough momentum through contact acceleration to be a tackle breaker. Credited with just five broken tackles over his last 475 carries. Unproven as pass catcher and inconsistent in squaring up his pass protection responsibilities. Has 17 career fumbles with nine lost.",0.047066218411067624,-0.05018064502916298,0.0,-0.04383298221366482,0.018175433740579533,0.061661988656994196,-0.04030345896234254,-0.06368537088511239,-0.06768690760021032,-0.0565981174743245
Kenneth Dixon,"Highly determined runner with a strong desire to compete through the whistle on every snap. Dixon possesses outstanding feet with exciting suddenness in his change of direction, but he’s very willing to finish his runs with authority and has a knack for finding the endzone. Dixon has all the traits of being a quality, three­-down starter in the NFL but his frame and suspect pass protection could be long-term concerns. Hungry runner who almost never gives in to the defender. Light on his feet using outstanding jump ­cut and lateral quickness to sidestep danger in the backfield and create a positive play. Elusiveness on second level often leaves tacklers grasping at air. Able to string moves together and hit the explosive play. Despite being keyed on, still creates yardage for himself. Determined and competitive. Accelerates through initial contact and squeezes carries for everything he can. Averaged almost twice as many yards per carry after first contact (3.3) than before first contact (1.7). Greedy eater when endzone in his sights with 39 rushing touchdowns since 2014. Quick recognition of defensive flow and adjusts running lanes accordingly. Decisive runner with plus burst and ability to charge it up to his top speed instantly. Has very 
good feel for running lanes and tacklers and is able to navigate both without much wasted movement. Violent finisher for his size and enjoys thumping corners and safeties. Reliable pass catcher who can hurt teams out of the backfield. Very average thickness through lower half. Struggled with a knee injury in 2013 and missed two games in 2015 with an ankle injury. Physical running style could lead to durability concerns. Not as likely to slip out of side doors against substantially better competition. Average long speed makes him more slasher than home-run hitter. Competitive resolve leads him to try and do too much on some snaps. Base narrows in space and can be susceptible to shoestring tackles. Aggression and competitiveness as a runner isn’t as readily available in pass protection. Needs to improve ball security.

Paul Perkins,"If Perkins had more size and play strength to go with his elusiveness, we would be talking about whether he or Ezekiel Elliott would be the first running back off the board. While Perkins' tape is full of ankle-breaking cuts, his draft value will also be determined by his ability to protect the quarterback and stay on the field in short-yardage spots. If Perkins finds the right scheme and team fits for his talents, he could become a high-­end committee back early on. One of the top creators in the draft combining elite vision and a wicked jump­-cut. Can disappear before tackler's eyes and put them on his highlight reel. Shows no directional tendencies with his cuts and can make defenders miss in tight quarters. Decisive when working between the tackles, but can bounce it when warranted. Flashes sudden, 1­-cut ability on stretch plays. Stacks moves on moves. Reliable hands when asked to help in passing game. Willing to stick his nose in against the blitz. Smallish frame for the big-­boy workload asked of him. Arm tackle attempts cause hiccup in his journey. Runs halted abruptly when tacklers square him up. Could be forced off field in short yardage spots. Missing NFL-­caliber force to run through contact and fall forward. Limited to swings, screens and wheels as receiver. Lacked consistent play speed with his wheel routes. Might lack requisite sand in his pants to be counted on for NFL blitz pickup.",0.036546802080221756,-0.030935451260281466,-0.03138897397747549,0.0,0.0,-0.029340358923134406,0.0,-0.01317771901782925,-0.036233962553517574,-0.04206861739810647
C.J. Prosise,"Ascending running back prospect with the physical build to handle a workload, the athleticism to create for himself and the hands to keep stacking total yardage up. While Prosise has the acceleration and play strength to fit into an NFL offense, he needs to become a shade more decisive and has to improve in protections if he is to become a three-­down option. Prosise looks like an immediate ""committee"" runner with future starter potential. Has every­-down size for the position. Patient, gliding runner with a sense for when it's time to hit the gas and go. Has late cut ability to create new yards for himself. Has effective open-field spin move to elude and the play strength to power through lesser tackle attempts. Efficient runner between the tackles. Runs with desired pad level maintains balance through contact. Falls forward in his finishing. Has enough play speed to turn the corner as outside runner. Experience as receiver gives him upgraded route ability as running back. Has opportunity to be effective on all three levels as receiver if matchup avails itself. Only one year as full-­time running back. Urgency as runner needs an upgrade. Can be slowed waiting for zone-­read mesh­-point, but indecisiveness flowing outside caused some lost yardage. Fumbled five times in 156 carries losing two. Needs to secure the rock against scavengers looking to rip it away at the end of a run.

Jonathan Williams,"Has enough size, heart and talent to be a three-down running back, but was a proven commodity as a fresh runner in a committee approach at Arkansas. Williams is one of the more creative runners in tight quarters that you will find in this draft, but teams won't have to sacrifice too much toughness in order to take advantage of his slashing style. Williams' physicals at the combine will be huge since teams are justifiably concerned when the long term health of running backs who sustain foot injuries. Loose hips and quick feet are his calling card. Crafty with outstanding lateral movement to side­step tacklers in the backfield, in the hole and on the second level. Light feet allow for immediate actions and reactions when needed. Forced 44 missed tackles in 2014. Has excellent instincts. Great feel through the hole maintaining distance from tacklers and finds the best running lane possible most of the time. Limited tread ­wear with just 406 carries at Arkansas. Sets up his blocks well and runs with good balance through contact and an ability to run through arm tackles. Played in physical running game and will finish runs stronger than most slashing backs. Dependable in short yardage with the fortitude for short yardage situations. Three-down running back with soft hands out of the backfield. Willing to do his part in pass protection. Needs to play with consistent burst and decisiveness. Spoiled between massive Arkansas offensive line that blew open gaping lanes that he won't see in the pros. Against Georgia (2014), made bad decisions to break inside runs outside because lanes were tighter than usual. At times, got too cute in the hole rather than planting and bursting upfield. Thin calves. Could use a little more thickness in his legs. Missed entire 2014 season after surgery to repair a left foot injury in August. Must get better at protecting football at point of impact.

Kenyan Drake,"Drake became the forgotten running back with Derrick Henry's Heisman-winning season, but he has good size, quick feet and can catch the football. Drake's draft stock could depend on whether or not teams envision him as a quality backup who could become part of a committee approach. Drake's physical traits and special-teams ability could make him a good value selection early in the third day (Rounds 4-7). Can be exhausting watching him because feet never stop moving -- ever. Able to elude defenders. Features second gear to burst through line and can string together moves in open field. Will press line of scrimmage effectively to set up his blocks. Legs keep churning through contact. Willing to aggressively finish runs. Will gain more yards post-contact than expected. Very quick feet with the lateral agility to escape from heavy traffic and bounce it outside. Used at times as slot receiver and has ability to be effective pass-catcher in pros. Was kick returner, blocked a punt and made several tackles while playing special teams at Alabama. Can be almost too frenetic. Mind seems to be racing with ball in his hands and he will show a lack of patience at times. Responds to what is in front of him rather than anticipating what is coming. Inconsistent hands with five drops to 44 catches during his career. Can get too dancey when asked to play downhill. Tendency to cut runs toward sideline rather than back into middle of the field.

Taylor's work ethic and toughness should make fans of running back coaches, but his ceiling may be as a change of pace runner in a committee. Plays the game with advanced understanding of an NFL player's son. Able to find additional yardage on his own with vision and outstanding lateral agility. Sweeping jump ­cut eludes sudden road­blocks. Can squeeze through a narrow patch when needed. Stacks cuts on cuts onto the second level. Has quickness to gain the corner. Never fumbled during time at Florida spanning 486 carries and 510 touches. Understands job requirements as pass blocker and executes to best of his ability. Shows lack of patience at time failing to press line of scrimmage and open up cutback lanes. Indecisive, at times, when approaching the line and seems to always be looking for the next cut rather than finishing the run. Doesn't have tackle-­breaking power and runs often end at contact.

Keith Marshall,"Marshall was a highly recruited running back who flashed massive potential as a freshman but never made his way back up the Georgia ladder due to injuries and incredible depth at the position over the last few years. Marshall could become a lottery ticket for a zone scheme team willing to take a chance that his speed and confidence return with a fresh start in a new location. His ceiling is much higher than many of the Day 3 running backs who could be drafted ahead of him. Combines size and raw speed. Before knee injuries possessed blazing, third-level speed. Had 12 percent of his runs in 2012 go for 15-plus yards. Has the burst gear and bend to squeeze through constricted run lanes. Tight, efficient footwork for quick lateral cuts before getting run back on track downhill. Makes early tackle attempts miss. Intelligent player who can learn quickly. Limited production in passing game, but able pass catcher. Doesn't look as fast as before his 2013 ACL tear. Appears to lack confidence as a runner.

frame and poor play strength that will force him into becoming a change of pace running back who will need to make his mark in open spaces when given his opportunities. With Ervin's lack of size in blitz protection, his best chance to make a team, initially, will be as a kick returner. Short-­strider in tight confines with ability to make sudden directional change. Despite lanky frame, doesn’t run with any fear between the tackles and doesn't look to bounce runs unnecessarily. Combines smoothness with quick reaction time to avoid traffic in the backfield and slalom his way through shifting, fluid creases along the line of scrimmage. Plus lateral escapability. Quality hands and can function as pass catcher with some matchup potential. Very good play speed and can punch the gas to top speed quickly. High-­knee runner who can gain yardage in chunks if run fits break down. Scored three touchdowns on kickoffs over freshman and sophomore year and has returned kicks all four seasons. Thin, angular frame that isn't built for sustaining contact. Runs come to a screeching halt against quality, bodied­-up tackle attempts. Balance through contact is poor and has trouble grinding legs through arm tackles. Hits from the side cause him to go flying. Not a one­-cut runner. Will take an extra step or two to gear down and cut. Size and strength limitations hinder chances of being a true, third down option at running back. Limited in his routes and times looked like he was going through the motions if he didn’t expect to get ball. On gap plays, needs to be a little less patient and a little more urgent in approach to the line of scrimmage.",-0.12159651149670514,-0.03631798839251174,0.0,0.0,-0.04799981673724132,0.029262350246807487,-0.0515539518243874,-0.04621624817319672,-0.023092695252175593,0.01130877530122048
Wendell Smallwood,"Smallwood changed West Virginia from an ""Air Raid"" offense to a ""ground and pound"" attack. Smallwood's tape features few, true flash plays, but the quality runs seem to stack up one after another. His intelligence in pass pro and ability to catch the ball out of the backfield give him an immediate shot as a third-down back, but his combine could determine whether he hears his name on Day 3 of the draft or not. Hits the crease with proper pad level and can spin off of initial tackle attempt on his way to additional yardage. Attacks his foes with lead shoulder at the end of the run for an aggressive finish. Runs a disciplined track as zone runner using solid vision and steady tempo. One of the sharpest players on the offense. Scans and spots blitzers on the creep and steps over to meet them as a blocker. Possesses exceptional hands as an option out of the backfield. Can use more beef on his frame to handle the rigors of the NFL. Monotone runner who tends to keep his runs at one speed. Not flashy or particularly creative as a runner. Gets what is blocked and is more of a physical finisher than tackle breaker. Has an extended gear down on outside zone to hit downhill cuts. Average athleticism and lacks the sudden jump cut.",-0.15001493115730508,-0.007905798674848162,-0.01007848576897733,0.0,0.038189612036416264,0.0,-0.1306853442700858,0.020149298424047196,0.0,0.05335236587026411

Daniel Lasco,"One­-year wonder who put himself on the map with a strong, overall performance in 2014 but suffered through a hip injury in 2015 and was unimpressive when he played. Lasco has some positive physical traits and might post some interesting combine numbers, but his lack of vision and inability to run with consistent physicality will be challenges when it comes to making an NFL roster. Athletic short-strider with potential to make a quick cut to avoid contact. Inconsistent play speed, but does show a second gear to burst past a tackler. Has some “get­away” in the open field when he sees daylight. Highly productive 2014 campaign creates hope that 2015 injury was primarily responsible for on-­field issues. Has adequate hands and was a weapon out of the backfield in 2014. Productive on cover teams at Cal and has potential to be special teams contributor. Not an instinctive runner between the tackles. Slow to process development of running lanes and appears unable to make late decisions and keep the run alive. Needs to show more creativity as a runner. Leaves too many yards out on the field due to lack of vision. Too quick to give in and end the run. Suffered through a hip injury in 2015 that robbed him of effectiveness and confidence. Needs to run with more urgency and desire. Gears down rather than accelerates when contact is imminent.

Keenan Reynolds,"Reynolds is more than tough enough for the NFL game, but his ball security issues are a major concern as he tries to step into the role of an NFL running back. Reynolds is tough but not physical to the point of breaking tackles so he must prove he can be creative and elusive and he has to show good hands to become a pass catching option as well. Adding to a return game could help his cause. As with most option quarterbacks, has heart for days as a runner and competitor. Elevated sense of purpose when play neared the goal line. Cashed in with 78 rushing touchdowns over the last three seasons. Can make himself slippery and rarely takes direct shots unless he seeks out the contact. Forced 23 missed tackles this season. Has plus vision with a great sense of when to cut it up and when to finish his runs. Runs with outstanding balance through contact. Elite intelligence and locker room leader. Doesn't have the frame or leg thickness of full­-time, NFL running back. More slippery than shifty as a runner. Lacking dynamic one-­cut ability to hit holes with burst. Thin lower half makes his running style slightly top ­heavy in space. Has to prove he can catch the football as a running back. Not strong enough to extend runs through force. Credited with just two broken tackles over his last 515 carries. Ball security is a concern.

DeAndre Washington,"Productive running back who was able to have an impact on the ground and through the air in Texas Tech's wide-­open attack. Washington is short but compact and certainly does not lack the toughness to transition into the NFL, but issues with drops and ball security could hurt his chances to make a roster if he can't prove to be a kick return option at some point during camp. Exceptional turnover in his feet. Gets up to top gear quickly and plays there. Gamer who lacks no confidence. Short but muscular with well-­built calves and a toughness that belies his size. Is unafraid of the work required as an interior runner. Works to keep his pads square and runs with desired balance. Can push through an arm tackle and is willing in pass protection. Dangerous run after catch ability in screen game and from the slot. Reliable and productive. Overall size will be a challenging obstacle to conquer. Predictably small hands may have lead to issues with drops and fumbles. Showed inconsistency and lack of discipline with his run path at times. More straight­-line quick and shifty in space. Vision is nothing special and is often late making necessary reads and cuts.

Leonard Fournette,"High-end talent with rare blend of size, speed and power. Comparisons to Adrian Peterson feel lofty, but from a physical standpoint, he's there. Fournette doesn't have the wiggle to make defenders miss and his vision can be iffy. However, if your run fits and tackling aren't sound, he can take it the distance in an instant. May have durability concerns due to physical running style, but has All-Pro potential. Full-on, grown man with outstanding definition throughout his body. Built like a linebacker with speed like a receiver. Long, powerful strides get speedy turnover. Click and go runner who hits his second gear faster than most big backs you'll ever see. Able to accelerate and scream around the corner for chunk runs against linebackers lacking speed or urgency to the edge. Powerful hips and thighs shake defenders right off. Tacklers better bring full force and technique. Always the hammer and never the nail. Violent finisher looking to intimidate run-support safeties with crushing blows behind lower pads. Runs feet through any and all contact. Has balance and power to plow through tackle attempts on an angle. Punishing stiff arms go viral. Has experience running from two-back, single-back and off-set looks. Hands are adequate in passing game. Can create for himself with power and speed. Wins in short-yardage and goal-line situations. Doesn't make many defenders miss with open field shake. Aggressive, take-on style could lead to shortened career. Struggles to elude sudden traffic at line of scrimmage. Lacks looseness of hips to jump-cut from gap to gap. Struggled with a bad ankle for most of the season. Plays through a straw. Excitable runner in need of more patience. Too quick to hit the accelerator and slam into defenders when there are still cuts and yards left in the play. Runs to obvious daylight but needs to learn to anticipate and finesse the crease in traffic. Doesn't see cutback lanes developing as outside zone runner and prefers to keep runs play-side.

Dalvin Cook,"Very talented runner with outstanding balance, footwork and burst. Cook lacks the power that you may find with some running backs in this year's draft, but he is a homerun hitter with a resume featuring monster games against his most highly regarded opponents. Cook creates for himself with elusiveness and speed, but his value could be diminished by injuries, character and issues in pass protection. If everything checks out, he could become a rookie of the year candidate right away. Uses choppy feet and compact stride length downhill. Keeps feet under him and is able to make lateral cuts at a moment's notice. Flourished in zone, gap and power schemes at FSU. At his best running wide while setting up lead blockers. Slows flowing safeties and linebackers with hesitation steps and glances back inside. Has run-away gear around the corner he keeps tucked away for special occasions. Darting style allows him to escape defenders who show gap commitment too soon. Plus vision. Quick to flow from first to second read on outside zone plays. Greedy redzone runner with ability to cash those checks. The brighter the lights, the bigger his game. Comfortable in both one-back and two-back groupings. Rare ability to cut it all the way back across the grain. Changes direction with degree of subtlety on second level without gearing down. Not much of a dancer. Tends to get hit it up the field. Feet in constant state of motion. Despite drops, can be dangerous out of backfield. Not always a tough inside runner. Can be early to bounce it outside rather than plant and go downhill. Needs to become more comfortable between the tackles. Excellent vision to the perimeter becomes cloudier between the b-gaps. Will duck head and finish a run prematurely rather than probing for more interior space. Not always small through the crease. Flashes ability to finish with authority but makes business decisions at times. Hips not as fluid as expected. Would benefit from use of a hearty stiff-arm. Inconsistent hands in all phases. Ball security issues with 13 career fumbles. Suffers from focus drops out of backfield. Won't square-up on blitzers and may not be reliable enough as blocker to play on third downs.

Alvin Kamara,"Ascending, competitive runner who has flashed explosive NFL talent at various times over the last two seasons. A committed runner with excellent balance who finds yardage that isn't blocked for him. While he has never logged 20 carries in a single game, he has the talent to play on all three downs if he can prove his durability. Spirited runner with NFL size and speed. Will open creases by varying pace of his runs. Burst to top speed is available at flip of a switch. Creates yardage with speed, wiggle and power. Twitchy and decisive. Strong lower body provides superior balance. Flexible and agile with ability to twist, spin and ricochet off of bodies and continue to gain yards after contact. Very productive; 23 touchdowns in just 284 touches at Tennessee. Well-liked inside program and a team leader. Can play on all three downs. Improved in pass protection and squares up blitzers. Has lined up at slot receiver at times. Sure-handed pass catcher with excellent burst out of breaks to consistently uncover. Has talent as punt returner. Vision can be hit or miss. Not an instinctive runner. Needs to see running lane develop and is missing a feel for reading progressions of his blocks. Makes inconsistent decisions on stretch plays. Can be his own worst enemy on third level. Will run himself into a tackler rather than setting him up for a downfield blocker. Consistently cuts left when given an open-field choice against tackler. With knee injuries in his background, combine medicals could come into play.

Christian McCaffrey,"Multidimensional runner with flex appeal for teams looking for a player who can carry the ball 20 times or catch it 10 depending on the game plan. McCaffrey's size, power and speed are just average, but he is able to create yardage for himself with his vision and elusiveness. McCaffrey's ability to return punts and kicks could be the value sweetner that pushes his name into the first round. Smooth, controlled stride length with choppy feet for instant cuts and change of direction. Plus vision with above average anticipatory feel for opening creases. Hugs contours of the running lane and staggers and stutters his feet to maneuver in tight quarters. Protect football while running through traffic. Reads keys quickly on stretch plays. Sinks hips into sharp cuts. Equally adept darting inside or outside and is able to string moves together. Won't dance on short runs -- gets it downhill. Feet constantly in motion. Able to make defenders miss on all three levels. Willing to keep runs playside and alters his track seamlessly. Runs with multiple gears and is able to gear up or down instantly. Has experience in one-back, two-back and offset formations. Excellent hands out of backfield and can be used from slot. Devastating quickness out of breaks can mismatch linebackers. Experienced, capable punt and kick returner.  Lacks desired size of an every-down back. Has some tread worn off his tires. Logged 300-plus touches (including returns) in each of the last two seasons and was asked to grind the gears for short yardage carries. Benefitted from physical, downhill offensive line. Takes foot off gas into contact. Doesn't have NFL-caliber power to break tackles and create yardage for himself through power. Can shake tacklers, but lacks a twitchy burst to accelerate away after the cut. On stretch plays, can get too cute continuing to probe towards the perimeter rather than choosing a crease and committing. Average burst may not be enough to race past NFL speed on second level.

Joe Mixon,"I've decided to give Joe Mixon a draft grade based on his talent and expected output if given a chance as an NFL running back. His draft slot will likely be impacted by his domestic violence issue. Mixon has the talent to be an every-down, all-day running back with the potential to take over a game on the ground or through the air. Life against weaker Big 12 defenses has created a more relaxed rushing approach for Mixon who will have to play at a faster pace as an NFL back. Mixon's vision is just average and he could struggle to create for himself in front of a subpar offensive line; however, he can play in any rushing scheme and can be moved all over the field as a matchup option. Outstanding burst to go from first level to third level. Goes from glide to burst quickly and can hit chunk plays between tackles and around corners. Can go from elusive to banger when he needs to. Will drop the pads and drive through tacklers in short yardage spots. Flashy feet for his size. Can jump-cut around defenders in tight quarters. Smooth hips help him swivel around the second and third levels. Able to show and go leaving linebackers diving as he escapes out of the side door. Strong stiff-arm helps would-be tacklers catch grass stains. Can turn the corner and create a straightaway to the end zone. Was Big 12 leader in percentage of explosive carries (15-plus yards) at 11.9 percent. True three-down back. Devastating pass catching option. Excellent route runner creating immediate separation. Soft hands to make the easy catch and the one-hander. Will step in and square up his blocking responsibilities in pass game.  Some in scouting community concerned with character beyond his domestic violence incident. Inconsistent as inside runner. Can be too patient at times. Looks for wide-open points of entry before he hits the gas. Can be nonchalant approaching line of scrimmage. Dances downhill allowing running lanes to become creases. Feet lag behind when headed into congestion and will get loose with his rush track inviting tacklers a chance to get a hand on him. Lacks creativity in initial stages of his run at times. Vision is just average. Fails to see backside cuts developing on stretch plays. Hops into his downhill cuts rather than a crisp plant-and-go.

D'Onta Foreman,"Former three-star recruit who turned that a chip on his shoulder into a 2,000-yard junior season. Foreman has outstanding foot quickness and wiggle for a back his size, but will need to run behind his pads and with more aggression on the next level. Teams could be split on his draft value as some may covet his size and athleticism while others will be concerned about a lack of third down value. Ultimately he has the talent to be a good NFL starter, but he's still a work in progress. Outstanding athleticism for a big runner. Smooth lateral movement. Has feet and agility for slide and go cuts from one gap to the next without a noticeable gear down. Finesses run lanes with subtle shifts and turns. Measured stride length optimizes balance. Swivels hips to swerve away from second level linebackers. Can hurdle open field tacklers who try and go low. Play speed is adequate. Has size and balance to pinball from one tackler to the next if he's not wrapped up. Jars linebackers and safeties at impact with his size alone. North-south runner. Rarely caught taking a loss due to ill-advised ""bounce"" outside. Proved he could shoulder heavy workload while cranking out consistent production week after week. Had tremendous conversion rate when short yardage was needed. Usually opts for finesse over power despite his size. Needs to become more decisive and aggressive between the tackles. Inconsistent acceleration into contact. Waits to churn feet until after blow has landed. One pace runner. Forced into 30 or more carries in six of his last seven games. Needs to press the line a little longer on inside zone carries. Impatient keeping runs play-side and looks to break back inside prematurely. Almost overly committed to original running track rather than being flexible with his reads. Burst is average through the line allowing defenders to get hands on him. Alarming ball security issues this season with seven fumbles and six lost. Poor mechanics in pass protection.

Kareem Hunt,"Big back with plus vision and enough elusiveness to make the first defender miss. Feel for the rushing lane helps him choose the correct path between the tackles but lacks the burst to turn the 4-yard run into 14. Zone-scheme runner with serviceable hands out of the backfield. Adequate in most areas and has talent to become a backup that can step in and handle a bigger load if needed.  Compact body with broad frame and muscular legs. Above-average agility for his size. Has hips and feet to elude darting defenders in backfield. Uses effective jump-cut to avoid the sludge and shift to the open gap. Runs with good vision and overall instincts. Presses the line before making back-side cuts. Conforms his run to changing space within running lane. Spin moves are effective against first-look tacklers on second level. Suddenly shifts to bounce an inside run to the perimeter. Strings moves together on outside zone plays. Runs with knee bend and forward lean. Adequate pass catcher for screens and check-downs.  Can elude initial tackle but struggles to accelerate after redirecting his feet. Average explosion traits. Marginal downhill burst through line of scrimmage. Inconsistent inside runner. Gets too cute in the hole when run comes to a close. Looks to spin rather than finish with authority. Needs to run to his size more consistently. Premature in breaking off play-side runs in outside zone. He might not trust his play speed. Slight gear-down into downhill cuts. Could struggle to find chunk runs on next level.

Marlon Mack,"Scat back with decent size and blazing getaway speed. Mack has plenty of wiggle to bounce from run lane to run lane and make tacklers miss, but he has a penchant for looking to break runs way outside when the interior becomes too trafficked and he won't be able to get away with that against NFL speed. Mack is a complementary runner who can hit big runs against defenses who have been worn down, but he needs to be matched with the right scheme in order to unlock his big-play potential. Looks like he has ball bearings in his hips. Able to swivel in multiple directions. Can tilt and slalom around defenders on the second and third level and is able to string moves together. Has slippery feet and is hard to pin down when bouncing laterally. Runs with knee bend and his pad level is low at contact. Explosive burst carries him into his getaway gear. Able to run away from tacklers. Six of his fifteen touchdowns this year went for 43-plus yards. Always plays fast. Contain buster to the outside. Finds ways to slither out of tackles. Hands showed improvement as pass catcher. Runs with inconsistent power through contact. Will need to accelerate through contact on next level. Serial run bouncer. Too willing to make wild bounces to the furthest reaches of the perimeter if interior lanes are gummed up. Lacks a committed approach between the tackles. Feet start dancing if he doesn't see an early point of entry. On jet sweeps, he rarely looked to cut it downhill in space and defaulted to the wide track.

Jeremy McNichols,"Average sized running back who has boasted eye-popping production over last two seasons. McNichols runs with vision and tempo and has experience in a variety of formations, personnel groupings and schemes. McNichols needs work in pass protection and will likely create yardage with wiggle more than power, but he has the ability to contribute on all three downs and could find early work in a committee before challenging for starter's reps. Able to elude sudden traffic in backfield. Not much dancing. Can shift rush tracks without tapping brakes. Fluid, flexible hips allow for multiple jump cuts and direction changes up to second level. Great vision and quick to process field in front of him. Trusts his offensive line and doesn't need point of entry for committed, downhill approach. Anticipates flow of second level defenders and responds accordingly. Good feel for interior running. Doesn't mind challenging tacklers. Stays low and finds crevices. Plus lateral agility and acceleration. Adequate speed to perimeter. Runs with body control and adjusts balance points to careen off tackle attempts. Legit pass catching option with five catches of 25-plus yards this year. Can be split out and work down the field. Two seasons of monster production on ground and through air. May not have lower body power to be NFL tackle-breaker. Can be felled by first level arm tackles and averaged just 2.1 yards after initial contact this season. One-speed runner without the big burst to rocket through line of scrimmage and onto the safeties. Quicker than fast. Elusiveness will wane as run moves up to second and third levels. Will get caught between finishing and eluding at times. Needs to do better job of protecting ball at impact. Fumbled eight times over last two seasons. Can be spotty in his protection. Looks to chop rushers down low and will whiff at times.

Samaje Perine,"Perine is a physical runner who can create additional yardage through power and can be a complimentary ""banger"" for a team who already has a slasher. Perine doesn't have the burst or play speed to be a dynamic lead back, but he can handle a heavy workload if needed and he should become an immediate short-yardage and goal-line option. Has build and toughness to handle a heavy workload if called on. Gets a deep press off line of scrimmage before making his cut. Able to fit into the crevices between the tackles and come out the other side. Very powerful through his hips and thighs. Creates for himself with power. Arm tacklers won't like the results. Drives through initial contact and continues to churn out additional yardage. Pad level is always where it is supposed to be. Delivers a message when he finishes runs. Short yardage winner and doesn't have much wasted motion as a runner. Decisive in his downhill charge but does so with quality vision. Not a typical third down option, but has the soft hands out of backfield to be a solid screen and check-down option. All bully with very little ballerina as a runner. Lacks loose hips to make sudden lateral escapes or take advantage of a late opening. Doesn't have the big burst to jet from first to third level. Low-knee action keeps his lower body covered with hands and tackle attempts. Has prolonged gear-down to make open field cuts. Needs a clear path early in the rep. Missing restart quickness when slowed by initial defender. Play speed is very average. Could have troubles getting to the edge against NFL speed. Has had ankle injuries in past that could require additional scrutiny at the combine.

Tarik Cohen,"Cohen uses a bounding, bouncing approach to the line of scrimmage reminiscent of Le'Veon Bell, but he's far less likely to finish downhill and instead looks to break it wide and out-race defenders. He's an electric playmaker who needs touches, but he's too small and unpredictable to handle much of an NFL carry count. Cohen gets easy separation as a receiver out of the backfield or from the slot and he will likely be used as an updated version of Darren Sproles 2.0. Nicknamed ""The Human Joystick"" for his ability to make seemingly impossible cuts. Plays with unpredictable movements. Can turn any play into a random game of ""connect the dots."" Rare ability to stop and start. Cuts are just as seamless and sharp from any direction. Field vision is excellent. Has lateral escapability to put would-be tacklers on his highlight tapes. Gifted with unusually large hands and a powerful lower body that enhances his contact balance and ability to drive for extra yardage. Very good acceleration pulls him away from tacklers and into the clear. Relentless competitor. Had four touchdown runs of 83-plus yards this season. A true weapon out of the backfield that will be tough to matchup with. Has good hands and is very slippery in space. Falls below the size standards expected from the position. Overwhelmed slower and less talented competition. Benefitted from heinous angles to the ball from tacklers he faced. Way too eager to take plays off script. Wants to swing for the fences on every snap and will have to learn when to hit singles. Too eager to bounce everything. Takes his share of negative yardage carries. Feet are electric, but footwork and run track on zone plays needs work. Takes big hits from big men when trying to fight out of tackles and squeeze out extra yards. Stature and short arms make him a tougher target for quarterbacks. Has almost no experience as a punt or kick returner on special teams.

James Conner,"Physical, battering-ram style runner who makes the hitting a two-way affair. Conner's lack of speed and reactive quickness could limit his role as a pro, but his heart, work ethic and ability to keep the chains moving could make him a red-zone specialist with the ability to handle some third down duties as well. Team captain known for incredible resilience and mental toughness. Leaned down and added more muscle mass this season. Arm tackles are a waste of time. Carries heavy momentum behind pads at finish. Drops shoulder to punish final tackler. Uses wicked stiff-arm to punch and swat tacklers to the ground. Creates for himself through brute force. Natural power in lower half. Doesn't need a clean point of entry for aggressive, downhill charge. Excellent contact balance despite heavy shots on his legs. Short-yardage specialist who can move the chains and score touchdowns. Willing to leave his feet and sacrifice body near goal line. Willing blocker in pass pro and showed ability to come out of backfield in wheel routes, swing passes and outs.  Needs a clean slate of blocks to consistently make his way around the corner on the next level. Could struggle to accelerate from tacklers if he gets too cute. Runs with stiff hips and heavy legs. Lacks quick-escape athleticism for sudden shake in open field. All power, no finesse. Early defensive penetration short-circuits his run. Average lateral movement and not desired amount for every-down back. Can be a little slow to process moving parts in front of him. Not a press-and-cut back and needs to learn to set blocks up better. Hands a little stiff as pass catcher and will fight the ball at times. Tape shows occasional confusion in blitz pick-up.

Matt Dayes,"Tempo-based, one-cut running back with good vision but an inability to break tackles and run with power. Best on outside zone plays with an opportunity to find back-side cuts, but when he has to run between the tackles, he's missing an aggressive burst. Potentially a committee running back with some third-down value if he can tighten up his pass blocking. Runs with patience and presses line of scrimmage to set up his cuts. Outstanding peripheral vision with ability to find back-side cuts. Sees to second level. Operates with controlled, choppy feet in tight quarters for maximum body control. Subtle wiggle on second and third level to create more yardage. Able to gear down and make the sharp, downhill cuts on stretch plays. Solid pass-catching option. Too small to be an every-down back. Runs with some hip tightness. Jump cuts and lateral escapability are below average. Doesn't accelerate into contact and is too easily tripped by arm tackles. Missing necessary strength in lower body to break tackles and create through power. Averaged just 1.8 yards after initial contact over last two seasons. Lacks long speed to finish the breakaway run.",0.07356447295075719,-0.034823741865023246,-0.03361406578524421,0.0,-0.023080630258339077,0.04135537471853679,-0.032861206227884306,-0.03218721415353279,0.0,0.04535667838359509
Wayne Gallman,"Comes with NFL-ready body and a competitive running style. Gallman has limited instincts as an interior runner and needs lanes rather than creases, but he's physical enough to bang out tough yardage. Gallman runs with pace and shows traits of being a one-cut runner who is better off with focused, pre-set tracks rather than searching for his own. He could be an early contributor in a committee with a future as an eventual starter. Has quality burst through line of scrimmage to rip through arm tackles and attack the second level. Runs with plus effort every time he touches the ball. Keeps feet grinding through second level contact. Uses shoulders as legitimate weapons of force against would-be tacklers. Creates additional yards through functional wiggle. Good outside-in cuts to defeat contain. Angular runner with build-up speed to win a race around the edge. Hard charging. Trusted option on fourth and short situations. Decisive in the red zone and brings some attitude with him. Finished with 28 rushing touchdowns over last two seasons. Strong second effort near the goal line when his initial charge is stopped. Will offer some help as pass catcher.  Leggy, long-strider. Unable to make sharp, sudden cuts in tight quarters. Extended gear down could cause NFL holes to close on him. Vision becomes restricted when running between tackles. Gives away three sure yards searching along riskier lanes. Lacks finesse in his game. Has bull in china shop running style between tackles. Upright in approach to line of scrimmage. Will allow tacklers under his pads too often. Gets impatient and won't always keep the track behind lead blocker. Below average balance. Can be upended by shoe-string attempts. Not ready for NFL pass protection duties yet.

Brian Hill,"Hill has a good combination of size and speed and is able to grind out additional yardage for himself but is not necessarily a power runner. Hill is not a rhythmic runner and may need a clearly defined run track. His experience in a running scheme that featured gap, power and zone plays should help him acclimate quickly into an NFL running game as he competes to eventually become a committee running back with some value as a third-down pass protector. Has size of an every-down NFL back. Effort level runs high on each snap. Does a nice job of allowing lead blockers to usher him to perimeter freedom on sweeps. Confident and effective over tackles and around the end. Can crank it to top speed quickly once he turns the corner. Functional strength in lower body provides balance through contact. Legs rip through arm tackles. Runs with bend and leverages lead shoulder as blunt force into second-level tacklers. Has some lateral glide to slide away from tackle attempts and bounce it. Plays like it matters to him. Fumbled once in 349 carries in 2016. Understands protection responsibilities. Squares blitzers and gives vigorous effort as a blocker.  Inside runs can be a little heavy-footed and lack tempo. Not a naturally instinctive runner. Vision isn't as clear as you would like along interior. Runs with some hesitation between tackles and will drop his head and bull forward rather than continuing to probe with wide eyes. Needs better timing for burst-gear through the crease. Can get caught up in the muck. Could use better finesse with his feet and his elusiveness is slightly below average. Is always in a rush and tends to crowd his blockers while they are trying to work. Heavy two-year workload included 630 carries.

Joe Williams,"Draft grade is affected by some of the character concerns that could preclude his NFL career from taking off. The more tape you watch, the more you become impressed with Williams' ability to keep runs alive that other running backs couldn't. His ability to create yardage for himself is a necessary piece of the puzzle for NFL runners, but his inability to contribute on third downs could hurt his draft stock. Williams has talent as a runner and could fit a roster spot if teams are okay with his background. Plus athlete. Has get-away burst in small spaces. Flashes breakaway speed to take it to the house if he gets up to the safeties. Sudden second gear to turn the corner or accelerate through line of scrimmage. Carries weight in his lower half, allowing for unique contact balance. Able to recover from hits that bring most runners down. Runs feet through initial contact and blows through arm tackles. Makes defenders earn their tackles and is hard to bring down. Can create with wiggle and power. Has lateral shuffle of a basketball player to slink out of traffic jams and escape outside. Can string moves together on second and third levels. Lowers pads to finish runs with momentum. ""Retired"" for a month before coming back after Utah running back corps was depleted due to injuries. Questions have arisen about his football character and commitment to the game. Ball security issues are a concern; lost six fumbles over 289 carries at Utah. Needs to press line of scrimmage longer before making his cuts. Will run into traffic that he might be able to avoid. Shows occurrences of hesitation if he doesn't have a clean point of entry between tackles. Runs a little too tall approaching line of scrimmage. Non-factor as third-down option. Rarely catches passes and not committed to blocking.",-0.10406730972227138,-0.0037672781575868973,-0.10815728270709532,0.03262518458773532,0.0,-0.05387172615974631,-0.025947544924937026,-0.0571133988883898,0.03971124158368359,-0.05935518924138729
Chris Carson,"Carson is an immediate winner of the eyeball test, but that hasn't always been true of his running style. His shift from finesse to a more power-based running style fits his size and physical attributes and gives him a better shot of playing on Sundays. Carson is suited to a downhill attack that allows him to be the hammer rather than the nail, but he's unlikely to create for himself with elusiveness or speed. If Carson works out well, he could hear his name called on Day 3. Built like an NFL running back. Chiseled from granite with a broad chest and thickly muscled shoulders. Reinvented himself from finesse to power after ribbing in the running backs meeting room. Lead shoulder carries pop in it. Drops pads at impact and is able to drive through initial contact. Bow-legged gait produces wider frame with better balance. Leg tackles often slide off and are left with nothing. Will press line of scrimmage to set up subtle cutback opportunity. Able to create separation out of backfield on crossing routes. Has adequate wiggle in open field after the catch. Never fumbled in 212 carries at Oklahoma State. Runs with tight hips and low-knee action. Runs too upright. Missing the flexibility to sink and cut sharply. Long strider who will struggle to gather his feet quickly enough for sudden change of direction against early penetration. Burst through line of of scrimmage is average.

De'Angelo Henderson Sr.,"Henderson is built low to the ground with the balance and power in his lower half to fight forward for additional yardage after contact. His courage, burst, and one-cut ability should appeal to zone-scheme teams while his pass catching and willingness to block gives him a chance to compete for a role on third downs. Henderson had prolific production throughout high school and college and plays with the mindset and confidence of a future pro. He's undersized but has the skill to compete for a spot on an NFL roster right away. Has access to an accelerator that gets him around the corner or through the line of scrimmage quickly. Ran a verified 4.49 40 in early 2016. Runs bigger than his listed size. Unafraid to drop the pad level and get it on with would-be tackler. Powerful lower body with balanced base to maintain his feet despite a big hit from an angle. Willing worker between tackles. Runs through initial contact and makes tacklers work for it. Decisive runner. Low center of gravity with sudden, one-cut ability. Prolific at scoring touchdowns. At his best in space. Good pass catcher with long speed and open-field shiftiness to hit the big play out of the backfield. Able to adjust his body to poorly thrown balls. Adequate pass-protection skills. Needs to develop better patience between the tackles. Appears to make decisions to grind forward a little too early at times. His creativity as a runner can be a little inconsistent. Has the feet to make defenders miss but doesn't always do it. Squared-up runner who lacks slipperiness to get through tight crevices. Needs work on consistency and technique in pass protection.

T.J. Logan,"Sleek athlete with excellent short area burst and the finishing speed to hit home runs in all three phases if the opportunity is right. Logan will likely be considered flex player on the roster who can compete for duties as a kick returner and third down back. While he lacks size to handle the heavy lifting as a running back, his play speed should not be discounted. Contain-buster who has a nitrous gear that rockets him to and around the corner on sweeps. Accesses top gear quickly when bursting downhill and can make defenses feel it if he's untouched into second level. Has rhythmic feet to make directional changes without much change in his pace. Decent lateral quickness in his cuts. Has some toughness in him. Willing to drop his shoulder and challenge cornerbacks and safeties when finishing his run. Offers third down value. Can sort through defensive fronts and find his protection responsibility. Able to split out or can match-up linebackers with wheel routes. Had just one drop against 66 catches over last three years. Exciting kick return talent who can change the momentum of a game. Hits his top speed early and looks to get it downhill quickly. Change-of-pace running back who lacks desired size to play through contact. Won't be able to create additional yardage with lower body power. Vision and feel is just average as an interior runner. Will choose the wrong path and dash into traffic. Needs a clearly defined running lane to unleash him. Tends to keep runs play-side and needs to play with better vision for cutback lanes. Could be typecast as a scat-back who needs to work from gun formation packages. Fumble rate over last two seasons of once every 37 carries is a concern.

Donnel Pumphrey,"Pumphrey is an efficient, natural back who runs with outstanding tempo and vision. Has outstanding agility and ability to disappear and leave tacklers grasping at air in open field. While he has good burst and quickness, he does lack the home-run speed expected from such small running backs. He won't even be an option for teams married to physical minimums, but there is a place on the roster for his talent provided he can become a return man or viable receiving option as well. Produced at high levels. Patient but decisive when he sees it. Accesses instant turbo burst. Rarely loses races to and around the edge. Plus vision creates ability to navigate shifting run creases like a seasoned veteran. Slaloms through traffic from side to side with seamless, tight jump cuts. Keeps tight track through the gaps, maintaining distance from defensive linemen. Able to string moves together. Razor-sharp cutbacks at challenging angles are his thing. Made a rare 90-degree cut out of a downhill run against South Alabama. Excels in outside zone but has courage to stick it between tackles. Extremely elusive in open field after catch. Used as matchup weapon out of backfield. Good route runner who creates necessary separation. Undersized. Lacks the leg thickness and overall physical strength desired out of an NFL running back. Spirit is willing but flesh is weak. Arm tackles are able to end his journey. Willing to accelerate into defender, but doesn't have the pop to break tackles or fall forward after contact. Quicker than fast. Will get caught from behind. Body catcher with average hands that lead to double catches.

Saquon Barkley,"Every-down running back with the ability to alter the course of an offense and become a face of the franchise-type player. Barkley has the rare ability to create additional yardage through elusiveness, speed, vision and feel for space in the open field. While he has been tasked with carrying a heavy load at Penn State, their decision to limit his carries somewhat this season could help Barkley headed into his rookie season. Barkley is a buffet runner who thrives with the more plates you give him and he has a chance to become an early All-Pro no matter which team takes him. Compact frame carries muscular, powerful trunk. High tempo runner with urgent underpinnings as his core. Offensive lineman's best friend with talent to dismiss penetration with deft footwork. Runs with optimal pad level. Elite wiggle triggered by fluid hips. Knee bend and quick-twitch powers sudden stops paired with aggressive jump cuts and spin moves to leave tacklers hanging. Can alter the course of the run whenever he wants. Presses line of scrimmage to give himself ample time to make his reads. Vision is solid. Keeps eyes darting when navigating interior running lanes. Exploits voided cutback lanes. Lateral burst and agility are top-notch. Has plant-and-go burst to rocket around the corner when needed. Good feel for managing distance between himself and defenders once he finds an opening. Feet are in constant motion and he rarely gears down to change direction in open field. Capable pass catcher. Effective separator in his routes. Beats up linebackers on wheel routes. Very tough and very competitive. Added two kick returns for touchdowns this year and will do what he must to help his team win. Football character and personal character are impeccable. More elusive than he is powerful. Has modest broken tackle numbers during his career at Penn State. Plays with inconsistent leg drive through contact when working between the tackles. Will need to develop a more north/south mindset as a pro. Doesn't always trust his run crease and will look to find side doors to bounce out of. Gets too cute with stutter-steps and jukes on first level allowing help to flow to the ball. Needs a little earlier commitment on stretch plays and sweeps rather than going through extended probing. Has bouts with focus drops as pass catcher and his catch radius is limited. Inconsistent at take-on blocks in pass protection.

Derrius Guice,"Evaluating Guice requires settling in for two full seasons of tape study as he was only healthy a fraction of the 2017 season. While Guice has some elusiveness and long speed, much of his success comes from his furious running style and ability to create yardage after contact. Guice's yards per touch was two yards higher over his first two seasons compared to last year. Like Leonard Fournette the year before, teams may be willing to lock in on his sophomore tape to create their evaluations and grades. Guice's running style could lead to a shorter career, but he has a chance to make a big splash early. Completely different talent on healthy 2016 tape as opposed to injured 2017. Well built combining powerful lower body with good overall size. Winning combination of speed, power and balance. Good recognition of early trouble from penetration and makes alterations. Has quality vision and is able to make sudden cuts without rolling into low gear. Rarely rushes as interior runner. Sets up blocks and follows the plan. Gathers weight quickly after cuts and re-establishes his base. Exceptional contact balance carrying power to punish second-level tacklers. Can create his own fortune. Has footwork and athleticism to spin out of tackle attempts. Able to push piles. Shows ability to impose his will in the fourth quarter. Angle tackles won't get it done. Possesses homerun capability when he finds open field. Not a classic third-down back, but can pick up patches of yards out of backfield. Dealt with recurring injury issues that short-circuited production throughout 2017 season. Needs to be more decisive through the line of scrimmage as a pro. Burst is just average. May not have enough juice to win races around the edge. Needs to do better job of dropping pad level at impact rather than just ducking helmet into contact as a weapon. Will opt to finish rather than spying additional opportunities at times. Has some hip tightness and needs additional room to elude tacklers when rolling downhill. Takes his fair share of heavy hits.

Ronald Jones,"Jones is a classic slasher with the wiggle and explosiveness to elude open-field tacklers and then burst to chunks of yardage. Jones was a much more assertive runner in 2017 and improved upon areas of improvement from the 2016 season. Jones also has the ability to turn into a much more dangerous pass-catcher than we saw at USC. He should test well at the Combine, but there will still be teams concerned with how many carries he can handle and how that affects his draft value. He's a big play talent with a chance to thrive at a high level wherever he lands. Runs with desired level of calm in the face of oncoming traffic. Trusts blocking development and hides cut intentions until the last second. Plays with light, electric feet that are dynamic in tight quarters. Elite plant and acceleration. Loose hips able to make rare cuts as sharp as 90 degrees. Deadly stop-start to ruin linebackers trying to pace and mirror him. Can find side door out of traffic and to the outside track. Maintains top play speed and is able to string together moves on moves on moves. Has lower body wiggle to dead-leg tackle attempts and slide by defender. Willful as a runner. Squares pads at impact for improved contact balance. Fights for yardage and falls forward. Had just two fumbles over 591 carries. Wasn't prolific as pass-catcher but is more than capable. Willing to stand in and offer some blitz protection. Relatively lean frame. Could require limitations with his touch count over the course of a season. Coming off of a 275-touch 2017 campaign. Interior vision can be a little inconsistent and will leave meat on the bone. Lacks a broad base and contact balance could become an issue on next level. Reactive runner who could still use a more fine-tuned rush plan. Needs to balance pace with patience. Can get too far downhill leaving himself limited escape routes. Has room for improvement with run track in gap scheme. Can improve tempo and rhythm to set up cutbacks on stretch plays. Takes too many punishing blows in his quest for additional yardage.

Sony Michel,"Michel is a well-built, no-nonsense runner who is able to combine vision, burst, and physicality. While he can make open field cuts to find additional yardage, his running style is more angular in nature and he thrives when playing north-south. He's not the most creative runner and he lacks some finesse, but his size, pass protection and ability to create yardage make him a natural fit as a future NFL starter. Muscular, well-proportioned frame. Decisive runner who rarely takes unnecessary losses by trying to be the hero. Runs with discipline and looks for the optimal path. Able to gather and cut quickly as inside zone and gap runner. Has good burst after cuts. Flashes acceleration to climb past linebackers and onto safeties quickly. Six of his touchdown runs went for 16 yards or more this year. Stout lower body can rip through arm tackles and allows for plus balance through contact. Has good open field vision to extend runs with second level moves, but will drop his pads and meet force with force when it's time to finish. Understands the art of setting up lead blockers and pulling guards. Highly respected, vocal leader. Excellent in blitz pickup. Understands his blocking responsibilities and will square up and take on rushers. Two-year captain. Has some tightness in his hips. Lack of agility precludes him from making late cuts to elude incoming tacklers. Low knee action in early stages of the run causes him to trip over blockers feet when trying to squeeze through tight running lanes. More angular runner than one who can make sharp cuts. Had some huge rushing lanes to work with thanks to scheme and improved blocking in 2017. Open field balance is inconsistent. Plays with a head-down, raging-bull mentality in short yardage and needs to improve his feel for finding creases. Will duck head and finish prematurely if he doesn't see an early opening to work with. Serviceable as pass catcher, but has had issues catching it cleanly.",0.25870978855167837,0.023470592159351805,0.04118161534184383,0.0,-0.00869147475864598,0.043870535770787075,0.024873439307864863,0.0018891814630693643,0.023467422211824754,0.0
Kerryon Johnson,"Has unusual build for the position with a linear frame and thin hips. Johnson proved that he was more than tough enough to carry a heavy workload to help Auburn impose their will on the ground. Johnson runs with good burst and is adept as both an inside and outside runner, but is more likely to become a grinder than a slasher on the next level. Johnson offers three-down value and could become an early starter, but his frame may not be able to hold up over the long haul if he's forced into high carry totals. All-State basketball player in high school who plays with fast feet. Has instant burst to rocket through the line and onto the second level. Gear shifter with access to a variety of speeds. Accelerates around edge defender and then gears down for downhill cut. Uses strong stiff-arm to dump angle tackles. Runs with juice and courage inside. Showed toughness and heart as a banger in upset win over Alabama. Creates with burst and physicality. Never gives in and squeezes everything he can from the run. Pinball back with the churning feet and contact balance to carom off tacklers and restart the run. More likely the hammer than nail when finishing. Goes from bursting to eluding to making the tackler feel it. Third down option who understands protections and rarely busts. Looks to square up one-on-one targets and has toughness to become even better in NFL. Effective on screens, swings and check-downs. Adjusts to throws outside his frame. Angular, upright runner with thin hips. Scouts are concerned that the combination of his frame and running style could lead to durability issues. Segmented downhill mover. Can be a step slow to navigate fluid running lanes. Likes to see a clear point of entry. Runs with average feel for lane development. Needs to learn to balance patience with urgency downhill. Upright running style. Yardage doesn't come easily. Doesn't avoid enough punishing hits. Hip tightness restricts ability for lateral cuts.

Rashaad Penny,"Volume-carry running back who plays with an active running style that rarely sees him slow his feet. Penny has the short-area foot quickness to create yardage for himself, but he doesn't really have the burst or long speed to be a homerun hitter. His motor gives him a chance to be a productive NFL starter, but he may lack the explosiveness to be a great back. Has desired NFL size for an every-down running back. Runs with short, controlled strides allowing him to elude sudden tackle attempts and alter his rush track. Able to alter pursuit angles with his movement. Will give ground to get ground around the corner. Presses line of scrimmage with conviction before making his cuts. Patient runner who is extremely effective at running defenders into trouble by setting up his blockers for success before cutting off of their blocks. Uses both subtle and aggressive fakes in space to hinder the tackler's ability to square him up. Arm tacklers won't cut it. Runs with strong lower half and swivels hips and shakes takes off of his lower body. Has slasher qualities as a runner. Finishes with a lower shoulder into tacklers when he's finishing. Posted impressive kick return numbers. Has averaged 31.9 yards per kickoff return with seven touchdowns over last three seasons. Sets up kick return blocks the same way he sets them up as a runner.  High-cut, upright runner. Despite urgency as a runner, won't break many quality tackle attempts. One-speed runner without a big burst gear to clear first and second level defenders cleanly. Has modest yards after first contact numbers over the last two seasons. Can get a little ""bounce-happy"" with his willingness to try and cut inside runs to the outside once he gets onto second level. Doesn't always show a feel for the best run lane choices. Will miss backside, cutback lanes. May not have the long speed to pull away from tacklers and hit big chunk runs. Scouts say he may need additional reps to lock-in on the playbook.

Nick Chubb,"Has the size and mindset of a primary ball carrier, but lacks any one element of his game that jumps off the tape when evaluating. Chubb isn't overly elusive, but he does a good job of running through arm tackles and initial contact with lower body strength and contact balance. Chubb could become an average NFL starter, but his lack of third down value may end up hurting his draft stock. Possesses a low center of gravity and strong base giving him natural balance to help stack yardage after contact. Has some pop behind his pads as a runner. Can attack edge with sudden, lateral cutback if contain falters. Has one-cut ability. Saw foot quickness and burst improve after sluggish 2016, post-injury effort. Has adequate acceleration to the edge and is effective with his off-hand at stiff-arming and separating himself from tacklers in pursuit. Shows proper level of discipline to keep runs between the tackles when called for rather than trying to bounce everything outside. Has footwork and feel to slalom through interior traffic and squeeze out hidden creases near goal line. Patient approach and runs with very little wasted motion. Ball security is a plus. Explosion and sharpness still not quite where it was before leg injury in 2015. Late wiggle is average. Needs to make early cuts to avoid tacklers. Tends to get bogged down when forced by penetration to make off-schedule moves early in the run. Vision is just okay. Shows occasional hesitance in reading block development. Would benefit by pressing line of scrimmage a little deeper. Would like to see him physically challenge tacklers more often rather than trying to shake them. Doesn't possess run-away speed.

Royce Freeman,"Freeman became the leading rusher in Oregon history thanks to talent, consistency and elite productivity. Freeman's high number of career carries will bother some teams as he doesn't appear to play as fast as he did earlier in his career. He has outstanding size and is a natural runner with good vision who could step into an early starter's role -- especially if teams believe he can handle third down snaps as well. Dependable and productive throughout illustrious career. Has impressive, muscular frame. Build produces some natural power and contact balance when he keeps his play speed up. Uses upper body strength to shrug off angle tackles who come in too high. Plays with a feel for block development. Field vision is good. Uses well-timed throttle downhill behind wash down blocks. Willing interior runner in Ducks inside zone heavy attack. Shows off quality footwork and directional change to keep runs alive when defenders beat their blocks early in rep. Contorts to shape of the run lane and squeezes through. Has power in his lead shoulder when challenging safeties in open field. Understands where run track is supposed to lead him. Used as screen receiver over last two seasons but can catch it. Could become a third down option if he improves pass protection. Doesn't always play to his size. Too willing to eat contact rather than dole it out. Can be slowed by arm tackles. Hip tightness prevents him from consistently slipping leg tackles on perimeter runs. Jump cuts gain limited ground. Appears to anticipate contact at times when attacking run creases. Below average elusiveness once defenders close him out in the open field. Tires are missing some tread. Has had over 1000 touches during his career. Has become more of a grinder than a slasher as his career has moved forward.

Nyheim Hines,"Hines has dual-threat talent but doesn't have the size for full-time work at running back and is in need of much more work as a receiver. Hines' value to teams could rest upon how they envision using him. It is possible that he benefits from the success of Saints rookie Alvin Kamara with teams looking to plug him into that role, but he's not on Kamara's level. Hines is a linear runner whose ability to cut and burst would fit with teams looking for a change of pace back in an outside zone running scheme. Two-sport participant who brings real sprinter's speed to the turf. Versatile threat offering creative offensive coordinators a toy to tinker with. Has experience as lone running back and slot receiver. Flashed his homerun potential with touchdown runs of 83, 54, 50, and 48 this season. Most comfortable when he's keeping outside zone carries over the tackle. Build-up speed can eliminate pursuit angles and thrust him into open space for chunk yardage. Quality stiff-arm. Plays with adequate toughness to gain yards after contact. Hands and catch focus showed improvement this season as a receiver. Possesses raw talent waiting to be molded. Has kick and punt return experience and has taken three kicks back for touchdowns. 
 Smaller than ideal as a running back. Needs to do better job of sidestepping big hits or face durability concerns. Better athlete than running back and better runner than receiver. Lacks feel for blocking in front of him. Hasn't learned to hug the lane and flow away from traffic just yet. Can be slow to see run lane development allowing defenders a chance to close. Needs to run with more consistent tempo and rhythm in outside zone. Vision stalls when attempting to find cutback lanes. Not a natural pass catcher and has dealt with drops throughout his career.

John Kelly,"Kelly is a little undersized but is a tough runner and capable pass catcher who has the potential to play all three downs if needed. He can add additional yardage with plus contact balance and an ability to push through tackles, but his average burst between the tackles and around the edge could mean hell have to live the life of a grinder. Kelly is a solid committee back with the ability to handle full-time duties if called upon. Stout and tough. Runs with low center of gravity and exceptional balance through contact. Creates yardage through power. Absorbs angle tackles and maintains his track. Often takes multiple tacklers to finish him. Runs behind his pads and hits it full-throttle into collision. Gave Ronnie Harrison work when they went head to head. Stiff-arm is just that. Able to push tacklers aside around the edge. Decent gather and cut footwork on second level. Competitive pass blocker who will sort and square opponents. More dangerous as pass catcher than numbers would dictate. Often run into no-win situations on flat routes. Displays wiggle to separate on route breaks.  Slightly undersized. Average quickness and below average speed. Inconsistent running away from tacklers around the corner or down the field. Lacks the ""hit it and go"" to clear traffic through line of scrimmage. Looks for lanes, but misses creases. Lacks creativity as inside runner. The path is the path.

Bo Scarbrough,"Scarbrough can be a runaway locomotive, but he needs a long track to get rolling or his effectiveness will drop sharply. Scarbrough won't make tacklers miss, but he is a brute force who can add yardage to the end of runs. Scarbrough is a one-cut runner who is best in an under-center rushing attack where he can get carries in bunches. He has the talent to be an effective NFL running back, but durability concerns and a lack of pass catching ability could cap where teams are willing to consider drafting him. His explosive testing at the Combine could intrigue teams who had written him off previously. Tapered, powerful physique. Is a punisher behind his pads. Can absorb solid blows and keep runs alive. Will always fall forward once he gets a head of steam behind him. Plays with steady tempo. Has surprising ability to gather weight and cut sharply downhill as outside zone runner. Generally comfortable making reads and choosing track from I-formation. Tackling him high ends poorly for defenders. Able to create additional yardage through power and long speed. Able to batter defenses late in game and then hit the chunk play. Short yardage touchdown specialist who can leap up-and-over the pile. Had dominant stretch against Auburn, Florida, Washington and Clemson late last year. Can thump in blitz pick-up. Hasn't had to handle a heavy workload thanks in part to Alabama's committee approach. Plays with upright running style. Frame too accessible for big hitters looking for a slab of ribs. Durability is a major concern. Has suffered through multiple lower body injuries dating back to high school. Long strider who needs a long runway to get to top speed. Doesn't have bend and footwork to string moves together. Too big and leggy to counter sudden penetration in backfield and needs runs to stay on schedule. Impatient with a penchant for crowding lead blockers and eliminating his own escape routes. Burst and feel for running lanes is below average. Defenders got hands on him much earlier in the carry than his teammate Damien Harris.

Kalen Ballage,"Ballage looks great on the hoof and should test well at the Combine, but his lack of decisiveness and vision make it hard to envision him as a full-time RB1. Ballage can do a little of this and a little of that, but a team will need to have a clear-cut plan for how to use him. Ballage's size and athletic ability will appeal to teams as will his ability to play on third downs and return kicks. Excellent body composition and frame. Possesses an athletic build with well-proportioned upper body and lower body that squats over 500 pounds. Versatile player who has experience as an off-set runner, a pass catcher out of the backfield and a wildcat quarterback. Has experience returning kicks. Plays with adequate burst between tackles. Lowers shoulder and accelerates feet into and through contact to fall forward. Has secondary power to find a tough yard near end zone. Clean hands as pass catcher. Displays ability to adjust to poorly thrown balls. Can line up in the slot. Able to slip first tackle attempt after the catch in open field. Needs to protect with better technique, but his size is effective in taking on blitzers. Doesn't have the hips or feet to cut with sharpness after flowing hard to the edge. Runs too upright to squeeze through tight rush lanes. Plays with early indecisiveness. Takes too many skip steps in his approach downhill allowing defense time to fight past blocks. Field vision is severely lacking. Allows open run lanes to go unused. Feet can get confused when faced with unexpected traffic. Athletic, but not elusive. Not nearly as hard to tackle as expected.

Chase Edmonds,"Edmonds is a highly productive runner with a compact frame, good agility and plus athletic traits. While he flourished against a lower level of competition, he may find that he's unable to beat NFL defenses with burst alone.

Highly productive four-year starter. Well-built, durable frame with thick calves and thighs. Hips can swivel freely. Quick to gather, sink and redirect when cutting. Uses acrobatic twists, turns and directional changes to battle back against would-be tacklers. Runs with good bend and wide base. Burst features explosive, long first stride.

Jaylen Samuels,"Some may see Samuels as a valuable hybrid talent, while others may see a player who offers roster flexibility but lacks a position where he can win consistently. Samuels isn't a tight end and has to prove he can handle blocking duties well enough to be a fullback. He will, however, appeal to teams looking to disguise their attacks with more diversified personnel groupings. Samuels best fit may be with a zone-scheme team as a RB/FB with the ability to play slot receiver and become a core special teamer. Provides roster flexibility thanks to his unique versatility. True ""all-purpose"" player. Used as zone-scheme runner, on jet sweeps, bubble screens, at slot receiver, outside receiver, and in ""Wildcat"" this season. Proved he could handle some running back duties this season. Had success using his size and effort in finding paydirt as goalline running back. Can make first tackler miss in space. Active with off-hand to swipe away arm tackles. Has intelligence to process expansive, individual game plan and take it to the field. Can separate from linebackers looking to cover him from slot.

Considered a hybrid player, but lacks a defined position. Tape doesn't show enough tenacity to help running game as an H-back. Play speed and short area quickness are average. Usually gets what is blocked as a running back. Need to see more vertical push into his routes. Tight hips prevent sharp cuts as running back or receiver.

Mark Walton,"Walton is a fluid combo back with the ability to compete for committee carries and third down snaps. His 2016 tape gives a better indication of his quickness since he was nursing an ankle injury for much of the time he played this year. His indecisiveness as an interior runner should be taken into account when offensive coordinators decide to use him. Walton has the ability to become a solid backup who can handle a heavier touch load over smaller stretches if needed. Short but stout. Has thick, powerful lower body. Runs with knee bend and balance. Loose hips can rotate to find sharp cutback opportunities. Finds yardage for himself when blocking isn't there. More decisive and confident when working from dotted ""I"".

Makes initial tackle attempts miss and has burst to turn a short catch into a chunk play. Good ball tracker on wheel routes. Hands are sticky like a wideout. Will stick a stiff shoulder into chip blocks and is willing to stand in against blitzers. Didn't fumble over his last 274 carries.  Way too much dancing as off-set back. Shows distrust of the blocking plan and will void the rush track early. Takes long looks for clear point of entry rather than finding the crease. Vision and decisiveness as inside runner are below average. Big runs come from bouncing wide. Run strength is average. Uses gather step pre-cut rather than plant-and-go delaying downhill burst.

Justin Jackson,"Jackson is a productive, durable runner with the foot quickness and agility to make defenders miss on all levels of the field, but has a thin frame that could turn some teams off. While Jackson carried a heavy workload in college, he's unlikely to find that opportunity in the pros. Jackson's elusiveness gives him a shot at a backup role, but he will need to improve as a third-down option. Unorthodox running style creates early indecisiveness in tacklers. Has decent initial burst when he has a clear track to follow. Slippery, flexible upper body is able to contort around interior tacklers. Has some decent maneuverability in tight quarters to find hidden yardage in a crowd. Able to gather feet and sink hips for sharp, downhill cuts. Looks natural stringing jump-cuts together when he finds a rhythm. Lateral cuts can be sudden and elongated for greater escapes. Plays with toughness. Has quickness and tools to become a more dangerous route-runner out of the backfield. Elusiveness can help him turn a four-yard dump pass into a third-and-long conversion. Slightly built with spindly legs and thin waist. Sets up in knock-kneed stance pre-snap. Runs with narrow base. Doesn't have lower body power to resist arm tackles. Tacklers finish his runs for him. Herky-jerky, segmented runner needs to smooth out approach. Accesses hitch step too often on stretch plays limiting his play speed. Leggy runner with upright gait. Defaults to early jukes and fakes rather than utilizing ""see and go"" approach. Hands can be clumsy when attempting to catch throws below his waist. Had to carry heavy workload for four years. One of just two players over last 20 years to have 1,100 career rush attempts.",-0.10878499739950662,-0.0369870939989751,0.02867930100259859,-0.03404904645547388,0.0,0.0260998216317481,-0.032647603765077624,0.05179019209762212,0.02858094944935807,-0.11713015516284077
Jordan Wilkins,"Finesse runner with good size and great agility with the lateral agility to elude tacklers in the open field and the speed to make them feel it. Wilkins lacks the aggressive running demeanor to take it to tacklers, but he does have moments of effectiveness along the interior thanks to his footwork and vision. Wilkins 12 carries against Alabama could be hard for teams to ignore as they look to project his NFL potential. He should find work as a solid backup with a shot at finding starters carries at some point.  Checks the height, weight, and speed boxes. Hips swivel freely and is very agile. Able to access any side door he needs to for quick escapes. Plays with slasher qualities. Saw over 10 percent of his runs in 2017 go for 15-plus yards. Has sudden, one-cut ability with the juice to launch himself through line of scrimmage and into the open field. Feet are light and nimble. Runs with knee bend and good pad level. Excellent footwork in tight quarters. Has balance and vision to navigate fluid run lanes. Glides behind lead blockers allowing them to do their work. Wiggle makes him dangerous in space. Not much tread off his tires as a runner. Averaged 7.1 yards per carry against SEC competition including 101 against Alabama. May have NFL size, but doesn't run like it. Much more flight than fight in his game. Averaged just 1.7 yards after contact. Slows into contact and doesn't finish behind his pads. Has moments of indecisiveness between the tackles. Plays with too much gear-shifting as a runner allowing run creases to muddy. Needs clear point of entry before committing to the cause. Tempo and pace can be inconsistent early in the carry.

Ito Smith,"Undersized workhorse with 940 career touches and 49 career touchdowns. For all of his production on the ground, Smith lacks the explosive qualities of a slasher. Smith's lack of size and burst could hinder his chances as a running back, but his talents as a pass-catcher could keep him alive in a camp. Runs with good bend staying low to the ground as he makes his way through traffic. Stays tucked behind blockers until the time in right on stretch plays. Runs with little wasted motion. Has one-cut ability. Vision is decent. Stronger in lower body than expected for a small back. Leaned on as a pass-catching option. Averaged 10.5 yards per catch over the last three years. Hands are natural. Runs mostly angle routes and flats, but usually gets good separation out of his breaks. Carries small frame. Doesn't often fall forward through contact. Footwork is overly deliberate when gearing down and cutting. Doesn't run with necessary suddenness for next level. Burst gear is below average. Has to play with quicker pace to stay ahead of NFL pursuit. His runs feature too much thinking and not enough reacting.

Trenton Cannon,"Tremendously explosive change-of-pace runner who will need to live in the cafeteria and the weight room early on to help build his frame up to NFL standards. Cannon has juice for days and that big-play ability in space will be very appealing to teams as a likely undrafted free agent. Cannon can catch it and has a history of handling kick return duties when needed so that may be enough to help him find a practice squad this season. Explosive athlete with breakaway potential.
Posted 38.5-inch vertical leap and 10-foot-9 broad jump.
Ran 4.40-second 40-yard dash with electrifying 1.49 10-yard split.
Gets to top gear immediately to pull away from defenders when racing around the corner.
Loose hips with lateral agility to make sharp, late cuts to avoid tacklers who are on top of him.
Homerun ability with 35 rushing touchdowns over the last two seasons.
Offers special teams potential with three kick returns for touchdowns during career. Smallish back at just 185 pounds.
Lacks frame for anything more than a change-of-pace role.
Unable to push through contact to break tackles and add to his yardage after contact.

Josh Jacobs,"Prototypical combination of size and skill-set as an every-down runner with the ability to slash or impose his will on any given snap. Jacobs runs with good bend, vision and burst, and he proved to be an effective pass-catcher out of the backfield or from the slot. He will probe and burst, but he could become more elusive with better tempo as a runner. Jacobs is a decisive runner with outstanding one-cut talent to become a bellcow lead back. Built like you want with low center of gravity and sturdy frame. Forceful and violent as a finisher. Gives extra effort for successful short-yardage carries. Stout base to balance through contact and beyond. Patient but decisive on outside zone runs. Allows blockers to do their jobs. Instinctive with timing for quick cuts off of block development. Comfortable as a single back or behind a lead blocker. Has gas to bounce it to and around the corner. Footwork for controlled cuts in tight quarters. Good effectiveness as a pass-catcher. Used out of backfield in packages. Has ability to track the ball like a receiver. Low percentage of explosive carries. Might not have enough speed to hit the home run. Gather and cut is slightly exaggerated. Tends to keep gas pedal mashed once he decides to go. Struggles to slow, gather and cut beyond second level. Doesn't create enough indecision in open-field tacklers. Content to default into heavy contact.

David Montgomery,"One of the safest runners in this draft with a desirable combination of size, vision, toughness and creativity. He runs with impressive calm and instincts in the midst of interior mayhem, weaving and battering his way through traffic. Smart teams will recognize his ability to create yardage for himself with his eyes, footwork, contact balance and power. Should alleviate concerns about his lack of explosiveness. Montgomery has a pro-ready game and Day 2 (Rounds 2-3) value as a good NFL starter. Compact frame is built for the rigors of his work. Instinctive runner with ability to stack moves. Patient runner with plus vision up to second level. Glides behind his bigs and sets up his blocks. Gears up and down to counter flowing linebackers. Rhythmic but forceful. Offers no easy outs for tacklers. Powerful lower body creates rare contact balance. Adequate agility to elude one tackler and then punish the next. Takes care of the football and rarely fumbles.

Has carried it 20-plus times in 13 of his last 19 games. Takes his fair share of heavy hits. Runs with some tightness in his hips. Unable to make steep cuts against the grain on backside. Below-average burst to open space. Low number of explosive carries during his career. Lacks pure speed to outrun NFL linebackers to the corner.

Miles Sanders,"Well-built glider with the instincts, footwork and agility to shake tacklers but the frame and pad level to finish with some authority. He can clearly create yardage for himself, but he has average acceleration and might need to expedite his downhill process as a pro. Sanders is more skilled than explosive, but he has the size and talent to develop into a future starter with every-down potential. Low mileage with just 276 career carries. Built like NFL runner with well-defined lowers and loose hips. Typically patient as a runner. Good vision and quick to process what he sees. Footwork to probe and dart around early traffic. Able to string his moves together. Instinctive with feel for crevices inside the run lane. Lateral agility for slick side-door exits. Runs with forward lean and squared pads. Possesses above-average contact balance and falls forward. Creates through elusiveness and power. Third-down option with decent hands and size to block. Never eclipsed 51 rushing yards against Kentucky, Ohio State or Michigan. Needs to run with more plant-and-go mentality. Gets too cute in the hole at times. Lacks explosiveness and speed to the corner. Average access to burst after a cut. No home-run speed in open field. Doesn't separate from linebackers on wheel routes. Chip blocks lack commitment.

Damien Harris,"Disciplined and rugged with a very strong sense of who he is as a running back. He operates with a good feel for blocking schemes and finds the designed yards while adding extra with his power and some elusiveness. He lacks game-breaking juice as a runner and will need to keep his weight down or he'll end up in the ""grinder"" category of runners. Harris is more likely to be good than great as a pro, but his size, every-down game and ball security give him a chance to have fruitful career as a solid starter. Well proportioned with the the frame thickness to handle physical work. No-nonsense runner, with no sign of cuteness in his game. Takes a committed effort to bring him down and runs through initial contact to fall forward. Patient zone runner with good feel for when to keep it flowing play-side and when cut it. Trusts his blocking up front and generally keeps runs true to designated point of entry. Has feet to slalom around interior traffic and a sudden jump-cut for alternative lane choice. Tremendous feel for space. Works away from traffic while maintaining efficient rush track. Ability to secure and maintain possession of the football is elite. More than ready to stick his nose in and mix it up in blitz pick-up. Scans for leaks in pass protection and uses good technique to square and sustain blocks. Very capable as dump-off pass catcher with soft hands and desired ball skills. Shared carries in deep Alabama backfield has helped reduce wear and tear. Doesn't have burst to and around the perimeter to consistently outrun speedy linebackers. Average burst through line of scrimmage will test his tackle-breaking talent. Improved open field wiggle considered average by NFL standards. Size and running style not geared to ""make you miss"" moves up to second-level tacklers. Struggles to get accelerator racing again when forced to slow feet. Hard-hat approach means linebackers usually know where and when to find him. Far-sighted approach as short-yardage runner limits ability to find subtle crevices.

Darrell Henderson,"He checks in slightly undersized, doesn't have great vision and runs with a narrow base that makes him easier to tackle, but so far, those concerns haven't slowed him one bit. Big-play production is impossible to ignore, but his running style makes him best-suited to a complementary slasher role in a spread-based attack. In basketball, Henderson would be the explosive sixth man with the ability to swing certain games in your favor if he catches fire. On the ground or out of the backfield, Henderson can catch fire. Home-run hitter doesn't begin to describe his explosive production. Averaged 8.9 yards per carry over last 344 attempts. Movement has electric feel to it. Quick acceleration turns to get-away long speed. 43 carries of 15-plus yards and 11 total touchdowns of 54-plus in 2018 alone. Unusual contact balance for narrow-base runner. Keeps feet moving at all times. Hits and spins out of contact. More physical than expected as run finisher. Used on drop-offs and screens out of backfield. Maintains potency as a pass catcher. Shows ability to track and adjust down the field. Comes in a little smaller than desired for an early down back. Upright running style with narrow base. Needs to get better at slipping solid contact. Displays some hip tightness and is a one-track runner. Plays too fast to effectively stack moves. High center of gravity forces turn rather than cuts. Faced light numbers in the box. Touchdown runs happening in wide-open spaces. Sees what is there rather than what is developing.

Dexter Williams,"Ascending every-down running back prospect who showed major flashes of becoming an NFL starter in his most active season to date. Williams runs with a good combination of feel, force and juice, which allows for a variety of methods in creating yards for himself. His evaluation could require additional character work and his relative lack of experience could mean a slower integration into an NFL offense; however, he offers exciting upside with the talent to become a productive, NFL starter. Possesses adequate NFL size with good flexibility. Stepped into bell-cow role with ease. Had four games with 140-plus yards and averaged a touchdown run every 12 carries. Understands block development and where lanes will originate. Adequate decisiveness as interior runner. Presses line of scrimmage to set blockers up for success. Loose hips to flow where his eyes take him. Processes traffic quickly to work away from peek-a-boo gap-fitters. Impressive acceleration. Mashes gas to win foot races to corner or hit the home run. Runs with square pads and drops heavy, pre-emptive blows on tacklers. Small career workload for fresh NFL legs. Ball security has been excellent in relatively limited work.
 Small sample size with limited tape against quality competition. Never more than 39 carries in a single season before 2018. Has an arrest (2016) and four-game suspension (2018) in his background. Slew-footed running style can affect balance through cuts. Needs to step in and square blitzers rather than defaulting to body rolls. Easier to upend in space because of narrow running base. Vision goes from good to average after he's past the line of scrimmage.

Rodney Anderson,"Volume runner plagued by a history of injuries that could make teams wary of him until after completion of his combine medicals. Anderson has good size and instincts as an interior runner, but he lacks the juice to be a dynamic runner and might be forced to earn his living as a downhill hammer with the ability to leak out on swing passes. His lack of elusiveness and history of season-ending injuries could force him to earn his stripes early on from the lower rung of a running back depth chart. Nose for paydirt with 21 career touchdowns over just 217 total touches. Runs with some looseness in hips. Instinctive in maneuvering through interior traffic. Feels width of run lane and development of blocking scheme. Rhythmic runner who can cut without slowing once he's rolling downhill. Patient hiding behind blockers and waiting for them to engage. Uses stiff-arm as reliable deterrent to angle tackle attempts. Powerful base with contact balance to shake free of tall tackle attempts. Capable pass-catcher out of backfield who is quick to hit it upfield. Good hands and flashed ability to adjust to poorly thrown balls. Lacks twitch and dynamic movement as an athlete. Running style is more gradual than sudden. Marginal difference in burst between first and second gear. Upright through the hole and takes punishing shots. Average speed to the corner could be trouble against NFL pace. Slow to restart feet once he's forced to gear down. Struggles to elude tacklers in close quarters. Suffered season-ending injuries in three of the last four seasons. Below-average awareness and take-on toughness as pass blocker.

Ryquell Armstead,"Face-first runner who doesn't appear to care that brakes come standard with the vehicle. Armstead's feet fire like pistons from the beginning of the snap all the way through his physical finishes. While he's not classically elusive, he does find his own yards by slithering through tight quarters or stacking yards after contact. His size, decisiveness and effort in pass protection should land him work as a backup, but his play traits could help him find more carries than expected as a pro. Good size with NFL thickness through his thighs. Known for competitive nature. Decisive and fearless. Downhill locomotive with ability to alter rush track without tapping the brakes. Needs no point of entry as inside runner and gets it in. Good feel for hugging contours of the gap and squeezing through. Feet are in constant state of chop, allowing for additional balance through contact. Runs with low pads and forward lean. Drives through contact to break tackles or finish falling forward. Possesses mindset and play strength for ""gotta have it"" short-yardage spots. Sifts to find his responsibility as pass protector. Willing to mirror and square blitzers with adequate effort. Could stand to run with better patience and rhythm. Aggressive nature leads to immediate gas into traffic. Needs to take a breath and allow blocking in front of him to develop. Short-strider with below-average explosive burst to the perimeter. Field vision appears to be narrow. Missing lateral agility to jump-cut around tacklers and bounce runs wide. More chain mover than chunk-play runner. Minimal factor as pass catcher.

Bryce Love,"Frenetic runner with explosive engine that was grounded in 2018 due to lingering injury and substandard run-blocking. Love lacks the desired size of a volume runner, but his sudden burst and top-end speed offer home-run potential that is unlikely to be ignored by teams looking to add a big-play option into their offense. Love could find his calling in a time-share situation, but his ceiling as a pro might rest on his ability to run with decisiveness and threaten as a pass-catcher.. Character considered an A+ by scouts. Highly intelligent and quick to process new information. Willing to play through pain. Keeps feet moving through his reads. Quick, controlled steps provide balance and on-demand acceleration. Wins foot races around the corner against linebackers. Burst and top-end speed to turn 16 yards into 60. Runs feet through contact as interior runner. Able to get skinny and squeeze through tight creases. Slides and pivots around big bodies littering his path. Rare ability to stay square in his lateral movements away from tacklers. Better pass-catching option than numbers would indicate. Tweener size might hinder both rush volume and draft value. Excessive stutter-and-gather in his downhill approach. Running style is more frantic than fluid. Will need to run with better trust and anticipation as a pro. Somewhat average in setting up defenders before his cuts. Field vision and recognition of backside opportunities is average. Lacks size to prolong NFL runs after contact.

Alexander Mattison,"Productive, willful runner whose combination of functional patience and aggressive urgency helped him find his niche as an every-down workhorse. While he has the ability to create yards for himself with adequate elusiveness and power, he's not a slasher or banger by NFL standards and he lacks burst to produce chunk plays on a regular basis. Mattison is a jack-of-all-trades backup with the ability to step into a heavy-duty role if called upon. His talent as a pass-catcher could move him up the RB food-chain. Determined runner who can carry lively legs deep into games. Averaged 30 carries per game over final five in 2018 and thrived. Runs with above-average balance. Decisive running style. Leaped over open-field tacklers multiple times. Finds additional power as finisher near the goal line. Probes with good downhill urgency and finds the crease. Outstanding hands out of backfield. Adjusts to throws outside frame and has soft hands to absorb fastballs. Hits it upfield quickly after catch. Chip blocks have some bite. Plays with a little bit of hip tightness. Multi-stepper to make lateral getaways. Prolonged open-field cuts. Does not appear to have a breakaway gear. Had just nine carries of 15-plus yards in 2018. Runs brave and takes too many direct hits.

Devin Singletary,"Undersized, three-down back with rare improvisational skill and toughness through contact to squeeze every yard he can from each carry. Singletary was asked to catch it less in 2018, but he's a tough cover out of the backfield and has the dog in him to step up and deliver a lick in blitz pickup. He ran poorly and did not test well in short-area quickness events at the combine, which could hurt his draft standing, but might not deter him from NFL success as a complementary runner. High-end production seems to follow him. Touchdown monster with vision and power near goal line. Quick to process and respond to oncoming traffic. First responder rarely gets him down. Twitchy footwork for instant stop-starts. Limber for long, lateral jump-cuts. Instant acceleration after short-area cuts to avoid tacklers. Shrinks to sneak in and out of creases between the tackles. Access to steep, backside cuts. Eludes lurking angle tackles with plus peripheral vision. Good feel for bold cuts versus subtle ones in open field. Willful, determined demeanor of a much bigger back. Rare ability to absorb powerful shots and balance through contact. Runs frequently end with him still on his feet. Creates through power and shake to maximize each carry. Route separation to threaten out of backfield. Courageous pass protection with a highlight reel full of greatest hits.  Volume runner in a change-of-pace body. Has close to 600 contact-filled touches over last two seasons. Lacks top-end speed to run away from opponents in space. Play speed tends to be monotone throughout the rep. Rarely keeps runs play-side and looks for early cuts. Excessive cuts will be met with earlier tackles from swarming, NFL defenders. Will need to learn to run a more disciplined track. Tendency is to bounce it to his left. Power diminishes when facing squared contact. Suffered from focus drops this season.

Trayveon Williams,"Productive runner who added weight and stepped into an every-down role and became one of the big SEC surprises in his first season in Jimbo Fisher's offense. Williams isn't overly dynamic by NFL standards, but he's a calm runner who stacks moves and eludes defenders to post his fair share of chunk runs. He's tough but undersized and might get pigeon-holed as a committee back with above-average third-down value thanks to his tenacity as a pass-blocker. Football character flies off-the-charts. Outspoken alpha who set the tone for the team. Raved about inside the program. Added weight in 2018 off-season to shoulder heavy workload. Coaches say he got stronger physically and mentally as season wore on. Transitioned effectively into pro-style rushing attack. Calm runner who stays in his shoes. Good stutter-go to freeze tackler and open perimeter. Tacklers had a hard time finishing him in space. Changes direction of the run without gearing down. Handled every-down duties and is a fighter in pass protection. Proved to be reliable pass catcher no matter the route. Looks small at times on tape. Has a tendency to play at one speed. Average creativity as a runner. Can do a better job of pressing the line to set-up blocks. Would benefit from more fastball in his burst. Will need to better decisiveness as NFL runner.

Myles Gaskin,"Durable, productive runner who could find the transition from college to pro more challenging due to his lack of size. Gaskin's quick feet and loose hips offer early elusiveness and success on wide flowing plays, but his overall play is less explosive/elusive than his athletic traits might suggest. He will need to run with better decisiveness and downhill burst to become an effective member of a running back committee, but his ability to play on third downs should help his chances for some early touches. Longer torso with shorter legs provides optimal center of gravity. Despite a lack of desired size, has been able to take a heavier workload. Adequate lower body looseness to side-step early penetration into backfield. 
Light in his strides with ability to make quick cuts on outside zone runs. Able to string his jump-cuts together early in the run when probing for his lane. Adequate burst to the perimeter in a foot race to turn the corner. Early access to his top gear. Extremely consistent and productive throughout his four years at Washington. Shows the courage to square up and take on much bigger pass rushers in pass protection. Capable pass-catcher with sharpened focus and ball skills when targeted downfield. Smaller frame than desired for an early down, NFL running back. Oftentimes looks for something better than the designed rush lane rather than trusting the path. Has moments of hesitation when attempting to make his reads downhill. Might not have a natural feel for run-lane development. Inconsistent as interior runner; needs to play with better downhill burst through the line. Creativity falls flat when attempting to elude second-level tacklers. Anticipates contact and will slow his feet rather than accelerate through it.

Justice Hill,"Hill is an undersized but excitable runner with a go-go tempo that can work for and against him on any given series. He runs tough along the interior and has the vision and agility to slip tackles, but his lack of size and explosive top-end play speed could work against him. Hill might not have the skills needed to handle third-down duties, so he could be pigeon-holed as a try-hard backup with average upside. Consistent play and production in all three seasons. Feet have good life and runs with a wide base. Willing to keep runs play-side in search of daylight. Limber hips to balance and recover against contact. Fast decision-maker on the move. Able to slam on brakes for sudden cuts from a full sprint. Shifty in the open field. Tight, rapid spin move to rid himself of a tackle. Runs like his hair is on fire and fights hard against the tackle. Has access to sharp, lateral cuts to bounce the run wide. Outstanding ball security with just five career fumbles. Undersized by NFL standards. Running style is frenetic and lacking tempo. Tends to crowd the running lane unnecessarily. Will careen off of his own blockers in the middle of his run. Doesn't elude punishing blows in open field. Some wasted motion open-field movements and jukes. Paces too quickly and fails to run tacklers into blockers. Top-end speed appears marginal. Linebackers can cut off his angle to the corner. Just five carries of 30+ yards in 2018.

Travis Homer,"""Run to daylight"" back who excels as an outside runner with clear paths to follow. While he can make tacklers miss, his lack of vision sometimes takes him to trafficked areas when optimal routes are available. He's a little undersized, but runs big and he already possesses NFL-level toughness in pass protection. Homer has his flaws, but he's a smooth athlete with a chance to outplay his draft slotting. His value as a punt gunner and third-down option gives him a chance for early reps right out of the gate. Has experience offset and from I-formation. Runs with pace and conviction. Good lateral agility for smooth bounce-outs. Bob-and-weave footwork to navigate traffic. Able to make the late, sudden cuts to slip tackler. Good speed and power to turn and finish as outside runner. Above-average contact balance. Doesn't slow into contact and finds ways to resist tackles and fall forward. One of the better pass protectors in this draft. Steps up and steps into contact giving blitzers a taste. 
 Fumble in spring game foreshadowed fumbles in-season. Fumbled four times at clip of once every 42 carries. Leaves yards on the field. Field vision appears filtered through a straw. Misses back-side one-cut opportunities too often. Inconsistent in setting up tacklers. Quick to duck head and bull forward when he has no clear point of entry. Takes on tackler in the hole rather than eluding him.

Tony Pollard,"It's hard not to get excited about a player with good size/speed and the type of per-touch production he put together at Memphis during his three-year stay. However, finding Pollard's NFL fit could be easier said than done as he's not a natural runner and is behind in ball skills and route-running as a receiver. He has enough talent to handle the packaged/gadget plays, but with kick-return value diminishing league-wide, he will need additional fundamentals training at one position to be more than a shiny toy that is rarely out of the box. Proven playmaker with NFL size. Averaged a touchdown every 13.5 touches and 9.2 yards per touch. Finished three-year run with seven kick return scores. Subtle shifts without breaking stride and runs through arm tackles. Used in joker role but has one-cut potential as runner. Adequate vision and cuts effectively off blocks. Not overly shifty, but creates some misses. Balances through heavy contact for YAC yards. Works into traffic as pass-catcher. Above-average catch-and-run option. Provides valuable roster flexibility.  Takes time to gather weight and cut. Can be impatient with the ball in his hands. Improv-oriented and gets off rush track as running back. Below-average short-area route quickness. Needs to be more sudden to uncover against tight man. Needs more bend and upfield burst into routes. Runs rounded, telegraphed slants.

Benny Snell,"Downhill grinder with an ability to create for himself with his vision and power, but lacking desired level of elusiveness and burst as an NFL runner. Snell is a touchdown hog whose scores were often earned and rarely given. Teams will like his toughness, size and instincts, but he must improve has blitz pickup to counter his athletic limitations. He needs to find the right fit to become an average RB2/RB3. Compact frame. Patient in letting blocks develop. Eyes are quick and decisive in finding his lane. Subtleties in footwork increase efficiency as a runner. Doesn't gain much ground with jump-cut, but it works. Creates additional running room with preemptive fakes in open field. Strong base powers through arm tackles with ease. Steadies through angle contact and falls forward as finisher. Touchdown monster with 48 over three years. Above-average catch radius out of the backfield.
 Tightly bundled in his lower half. Runs with heavy feet when working in tight quarters. Below-average lateral quickness and change of direction. Stalls when there is no point of entry. Has trouble getting geared back up once he slows his feet. Unable to squeeze through the crevices. Very average burst through line of scrimmage. No breakaway speed. Needs better posture, balance and hands in pass pro.

Mike Weber,"Adequately skilled runner with decent size who can get what is blocked but is unlikely to find his own yards often enough at the NFL level. Weber does a nice job of spying second-level linebackers and making lane choices relative to where the defensive flow is headed. However, even when he sees it, he struggles to access enough acceleration to rip past the first two levels of tacklers. He can make the initial tackler miss but doesn't string moves together effectively. He could have a career cap as a RB3. Vision is a strength. Smooth downhill decision-maker from off-set gun formation. Good agility to skip around traffic near his feet. Able to work around early traffic and keep run alive. Plus instincts to choose clearest paths once he's in open field. Possesses desired level of balance through contact. Reliable leak-out option in passing game. Catches football naturally and can range outside his frame. Inefficient in stacking moves. Monotone downhill pace. Will need to hasten his operation time. Doesn't have desired level of burst getting through the line. Below-average acceleration out of stop-start movements. Hip tightness requires runway to complete cuts and change of direction.

Kerrith Whyte,"Whyte put together impressive production in 2018 despite getting half the carries of celebrated starter, Devin Singletary. He is more of a slasher than a pure runner and is much more comfortable with clear points of entry or with plays flowing wide. He can stick and go with excellent burst and is physical by nature. He has complementary back size and lacks consistent third down skill, but his speed could make him a developmental backup and starting kick returner. 10 touchdowns in 144 touches from scrimmage in 2018. Tough, explosive runner with good early pace. One-cut talent with burst to drive past second level. Decisive in his attack
Good foot quickness to manage tight quarters. Has speed to turn corner wide. Runs aggressively through contact with above-average balance. Late hip slip to elude angle tackles
Willing to sit and square blitzers. Career average of 26.1 yards per kick return. Hits it downhill with no-nonsense return style.  Needs to learn to press line of scrimmage with discipline. Vision is below average. Ramrod running style leaves yards on the field. Needs more finesse in finding tracks between the tackles. Tardy in setting up tacklers to miss.

Chandler Cox,"Cox possesses a tenacious field demeanor and plays every snap with the same intensity and effort regardless of opponent. He can work as an H-back or fullback but will be unable to dislodge linebackers on downhill iso-blocks and can be much more effective as a lead blocker on outside zone with the pass-catching acumen to handle play-action leakouts. He lacks speed as a core special teamer, but he gets after it when asked to protect his quarterback and that should improve his chances to make a roster. Started all four seasons. Relentless and fearless. Versatile H-back with fullback toughness. Never turns down an opportunity to bang. Instinctive making reads to find proper blocks in space. Takes good angles into contact. Good effort and feet to get defenders sealed. Adequate pass-catcher with consistent hands. Sticky and trustworthy in pass pro. Undersized by NFL standards. Small hands and short arms.

D'Andre Swift,"Swift possesses the play traits and running style of a skillful NFL veteran and is the latest in an avalanche of talented Georgia backs. Tempo and decisiveness are his calling cards, making him a highly talented inside/outside zone runner. He's a cerebral runner who understands block timing and uses quick-cut agility and rare spatial awareness to read and react to defenses beyond the second level. Swift isn't overly explosive as a home-run hitter and doesn't run with the violence of last year's top running back, Josh Jacobs. He can step right in and provide early stability and production as an efficient, every-down back with Offensive Rookie of the Year potential. Compact build with strong lower body and three-down talent. Understands blocking schemes and trusts his big guys up front. Reads overflowing linebackers on zone carries making early run-lane adjustments. Rare feel and vision in tight quarters as interior runner. Listens to fluidity of the crease and takes what it gives him. Effective jump-cut allows him to press runs deep into the hole. Tremendous feel for spatial relationship. Maintains balance through twists, turns and contact. Gets right on top of tacklers before cutting. Quick to find acceleration after slowing his feet. Can run expanded route tree and separate out of breaks. Hands are soft and sticky as pass-catcher. Willing to step into pass protection duties and has some dog in him. Ball security is well below NFL standards, with a low carries-per-fumble mark. Quicker than fast, lacking home-run burst. Get-away burst to the outside is just average. Doesn't move piles or finish with plus authority. Ends up working harder than other backs to find explosive runs. Will need to learn to use his hands in pass protection.

Jonathan Taylor,"Supremely productive, well-built runner with an all-day, every-day mentality that helped lead him to three Big Ten rushing titles. Taylor runs with bend and burst as an outside runner and has home-run speed once he gets into the open field. He displays an ability to weave around interior traffic but might have evolved into more of a thinker than reactor inside due to fumbling issues and the litany of loaded fronts he faced. His patience and understanding of the where/when of blocks allowed him to thrive in multiple run schemes. He's more body puncher than knockout artist, wearing down his opponents with carry after carry. His traits, toughness and talent should make him an early starter with a solid ceiling and more third-down potential than we saw at Wisconsin. Prototypical height, weight, speed and durability. Hit 200-plus yards 12 times during career. Rarely rushes the run and allows lead blocks to eat. Deep line of scrimmage press for cutback freedom. Sinks, plants and cuts with one-cut talent. Navigates and flows with contours of the run lane. Burst around the corner outpaces pursuit. Former track man with a breakaway gear. Plays with good bend and forward lean. Balances through contact for additional yardage. Possesses talent to make something out of nothing. Chops out legs from under blitzers. Showed some route-running ability against Northwestern. Tallied over 300 touches in all three years. Wear and tear could be a concern for NFL teams. Fumbled 15 times over three years. Occasional hesitation processing interior. Lacks fluid jump-cuts. Slows feet and covers into contact inside at times. Anticipates second-level moves instead of splitting defenders. Not a powerful pile mover in tight quarters.

Cam Akers,"Despite a disappointing win-loss record and a lack of blocking up front, Akers maintained a consistent level of play that represents his football character. He runs with tempo and flow but alters his rush track at a moment's notice when needed. He is elusive but lacking the instant burst of a slasher capable of stacking long runs in a single game. Akers has above-average open-field vision once he's into the second level and looks to run through the tackler's pads as a finisher. He's a three-down option with good feel for finding the crease near the goal line, but ball security needs to improve. He can be Leg 1 or 2 of a tandem rushing attack and is one of the more natural runners in the draft. Compact, rocked-up build with powerful legs. Played behind subpar run blocking and often found his own production. Tough finisher who's able to shred arm tackles and balance through contact. Wicked open-field spin move to slip defender. Instinctive runner with good feel for run-lane development. Multiple cuts and run-lane resets without losing momentum. Eyes and feet work in unison.

Clyde Edwards-Helaire,"Compact, sudden back who runs low to the ground with power and balance to break tackles and the agility to bob, weave and shake them in tight quarters. Edwards-Helaire runs with instinctive eyes and quick-cut foot speed. He doesn't really have tells or tendencies and can alter the rush track when needed, which makes him so unpredictable for defenses. While he can create for himself, he's better off working inside-out as NFL linebackers might be able to outflank him on pure outside runs. He has pop behind his pads but lacks short-yardage size. He has the talent to become a good, three-down back in time, but needs to improve in pass protection. Ball security is outstanding. Runs low to the ground with superb bend and balance. 36 percent of his carries were for first downs or touchdowns in 2019. Can cut-and-go without stopping anywhere on field. Quick gather and cut agility laterally or on downhill flow. Has spin move, elongated jump cut, and sudden double cut in his bag. Makes tacklers miss in a phone booth.

J.K. Dobbins,"Good football player who bounced back from a sub-par 2018. Proved he could shoulder a heavy load and rise to the occasion against the best his schedule had to offer. He can make a sudden tackler miss and fits as a one-cut runner, but his running style is more battle axe than buzzsaw as a lunch-pail runner with the fortitude and toughness to wear down defenses. Dobbins isn't going to be that creative back with the wiggle and juice to create something out of nothing, but he has the efficiency, production and third-down value teams covet. Dobbins could land a shared-carries role quickly and has the potential to become a solid NFL starter. Beach body with chiseled, compact build. Big games met with big performances in 2019. Never missed a game and played through pain. Beat on defenses as a high-volume bell-cow in 2019. Steady supply of contact balance to absorb and move forward. Ankle flexion and foot gather for tighter cuts on stretch plays. Talented at slipping inside of overflow pursuit. Good peripheral vision once he's up to the second level. Runs with low, squared pads.

Zack Moss,"Watching Moss' game tape is like watching an exercise in controlled violence on just about every carry, but his vision, balance, patience and wiggle are additional skills that help to make him a well-rounded runner. Personnel evaluators for NFL teams say there is wear and tear that could limit the length of his career. He needs to become more discerning with his physical challenges if he wants to see a second contract. He is a great fit for gap and inside, zone-heavy rushing attacks and could become an effective starter as a middle-round pick. Well-built with power dispersed throughout. Both patient and urgent gears at his disposal. Runs with rare calm in the face of early penetration. Underrated vision to process and game plan beyond the line of scrimmage. Adequate burst inside with feel for the contour of the running lane. Short-stepping running style with elite contact balance. Arm tacklers might want to call in sick.

Darrynton Evans,"Slashing outside-zone runner with glide in his stride and ability to run with elusiveness and creativity. Evans is a little undersized and might be viewed as a change-of-pace option, but he appears to have the three-down skill set to handle committee carries. He can run with patience, but has the loose hips and agile feet to plant-and-go in a hurry. He sees the field and does a nice job of setting up and eluding tacklers with lateral cuts or stacked moves. While he's confident in space, Evans lacks the commitment and finishing force to make a living inside the tackles. His third-down and kick-return versatility increases the likelihood that Evans will hear his name called in the middle rounds with a chance to become a solid RB2. Grabbed larger chunks of production pie in both 2018 and 2019. Has talent as one-cut back in outside zone. Runs low and smooth with plus change of direction quickness. Rare ball security with no fumbles in 482 carries. Hips are fluid and loose for short-area swivel. Takes away tackle angles once he's past second level.

AJ Dillon,"Built like a minibus but possessing enough vision and finesse to avoid being pigeon-holed as just a pure power back. Dillon is capable of handling heavy workloads and wearing down defenses, but there is a concern from evaluators that it's taken a physical toll on him. He's a disciplined runner who trusts his blocking scheme and follows his rush track. He's a good one-cut runner with below-average wiggle but natural power to create yards after contact. Dillon will find more space as he faces fewer loaded boxes as a pro, but dropping weight and adding quickness could be the difference between a future as a committee back or starter. Carries weight easily on big, well-proportioned frame. Above-average athletic traits for such a big runner. Went for 150-plus rushing yards in almost 42 percent of his career starts. Finds paydirt, with 39 career rushing touchdowns. Can move piles or leap over them. Absorbs contact like a big linebacker. Trusts the process and follows design of the rush track. Reads block development and acts decisively. Has grind-it-out mentality, but pitch plays and outside zone suits him. Stiff-arm cleans up the angles on the perimeter. Able to sort the rush and find his protection most of the time. Size to square and slow charging linebackers.  May need to play lighter for increased quickness. Ran odometer high through rough terrain in BC offense. Scouts concerned about long-term durability. Not much creativity to elude sudden traffic in his face.

Eno Benjamin,"Slightly undersized three-down option with unorthodox running style that can keep everyone on the field guessing, including his own team. Benjamin thrives when runs go off schedule but also has a habit of taking them off schedule prematurely. His elusiveness is always on display, but he's a competitive, tough runner when it is time to get down. Benjamin needs a spread-based running game that allows for more space and freedom but must become more decisive as an NFL back. He offers value in a dual run-catch capacity on Day 2 (Rounds 2-3). Excellent three-down production as starter. When you think he's tackled, he's not. Eludes, accelerates and escapes. Changes speed to manipulate edge and turn the corner. Eliminates overpursuit with cutbacks. Runs with excellent competitive streak inside/outside. Staccato footwork to slalom around traffic. Hard-nosed, with plenty of pop as finisher. Alters platform, making him a slippery tackle target. Effective pass catcher and hard to guard out of backfield. Knows where to be and makes an effort in pass pro.  Noticeable drop in production from 2018. Could take time adjusting to a pro-style rush attack. Feels unsure when approaching the muck. One-cut opportunities turn into a series of moves. Spends too much time setting up LBs instead of bursting past. Hip tightness restricts sharpness of downhill cuts. Takes on heavy collisions too often. Occasional focus drops on easy catch attempts.

DeeJay Dallas,"Dallas was a high school quarterback who came into Miami as a receiver and converted to running back during the 2017 season. The production is modest and the instincts are a work in progress, but there are flashes of run-lane feel and downhill smoothness that could be a sign of future development. He has size, speed and a surprising amount of pop as a finisher. His contact balance makes him hard to bring down through contact, but he needs to improve his open-field wiggle. He lacks third-down readiness, but his special teams talent should make up for that. The traits and toughness make him an intriguing upside prospect on Day 3. Played WR and RB at Miami. Added bad weight in 2018, but slimmed down in 2019. Instincts and feel for rush track improved during season. Does a nice job of running tacklers into blocks. Plus burst with decent getaway juice at his disposal. Willing accelerator through contact for heavy forward finish. Slippery to tackle and hard to get down. Choppy feet and contact balance to keep runs going. Potential to become a four-phase special-teamer with return talent. Still learning to hone his instincts as a runner. Inconsistent processing and resolving sudden traffic. More one speed than patient in his approach. Below average setting up open-field tacklers on the levels to miss. Still figuring out efficiency of footwork for downhill cuts. Doesn't always know where he needs to be in protection. Take-on technique will need work.

La'Mical Perine,"Backup-caliber running back who fails to dazzle in any particular area, but who does enough of what's asked of him and has the character traits to become a dependable pro. He's most skilled in the early stages of the run, where his sticky feet and quick eyes help him find his initial rush tracks, but his lack of burst and second-level creativity make him more of a grinder than a playmaker. He has the play traits to compete for a backup role in a one-cut scheme, and his special teams experience improves his chances. Prototypical size of today's NFL running back. High-character, hard worker on and off the field. Gets behind the wheel and patiently steers lead blockers into their targets. Plays with decisive eyes and sticky feet for sharp gather and cut. Foot twitch to bound back and forth around early penetration. Understands the physical nature of his job. Low center of gravity allows for additional balance to defeat arm tackles. Intuitive near goal line with ability to spot routes to pay dirt. Experience as core special-teams player in 2018. Rarely drops it as pass-catcher and has potential to get better as blocker. Tends to run with monotonous tempo, allowing linebackers to find him. Lacks desired burst to accelerate both inside and outside. Early shake tends to dissipate once he hits second level. Drops head and plows forward prematurely rather than re-setting rush path at times. Takes on excessive amount of contact for his carry total. Still training eyes to recognize protection duties.

Anthony McFarland,"McFarland runs hard, but he's not that big and he's not that creative, so he could struggle to find yardage for himself. A high-ankle sprain may have been at the root of his unimpressive 2019 tape, as he showed a little better burst and tackle-breaking ability in 2018, but in both seasons he needed either clear points of entry or to be operating in open space to get it going. His projection can't just rely on a couple of splash performances from 2018. He appears to have low-end backup potential, but it's worth noting that some NFL teams are much higher on him. Better 2018 tape due to high-ankle sprain in 2019. Has build-up speed to run away from tacklers. Had runs of 75, 81, and 52 yards against Ohio State in 2018. Accelerates into contact behind pads. Agility to sidestep foot traffic. Able to stack cuts on top of cuts. Decisive runner between the tackles. Adjusts to off-target throws out of backfield. Capable ball tracker on wheel routes.  Runs on tiptoes on stretch plays. Slow to gather in cut. Lacks desired feel for run lane development. Needs plenty of space to operate. Unable to slow feet and then reignite quickly.

Ke'Shawn Vaughn,"Comes into the league with NFL size and toughness, but his success could be tied to scheme and blocking up front due to physical limitations. Vaughn is a tight-hipped runner who has issues with stop-start quickness and is unable to stack moves on top of moves. He's not hard to find, but can be hard to tackle. He's best suited to compete as a backup in a one-cut rushing attack from under center where he can build momentum and create yards after contact. His 2018 tape was better than his 2019 season and he appears headed for a middle-round selection. Prototypical size of an early-down running back. Muscular, well-built legs and arms. Scored a touchdown once every 16.5 touches at Vanderbilt. Former high school sprinter with finishing speed in open field. Adequate lateral agility in tight quarters. Consistent production despite suspect blocking up front. Runs with patience as outside zone back. Breaks through arm tackles regularly. Keeps runs alive with leg drive and determination. Plays up to his size and strength as pass blocker.  Vision and ability to create for himself are average. Very tight hips with very tight strides. Can race to the edge, but struggles to flatten around the corner. Takes time to accelerate after slowing feet. Not much ability to avoid contact. More of a ""one move and finish"" type runner. Lacks NFL-level burst to shoot past traffic. Very few carries of 20-plus yards this year.

Raymond Calais,"Change-of-pace back with very good burst but below average size that could limit his NFL suitors. Calais is fairly talented (and courageous) as an inside/outside zone runner, but as a pro, he will likely be considered a gadget back who makes his living in open space. His play speed is what gives him a chance, but he needs to run with better patience to improve his control and elusiveness in the open field. He's not much of a third-down option, but his history as a punt-team gunner works in his favor. Impressive burst to race past second level. Able to take away downhill angles for support safeties. Plenty of juice to threaten perimeter on stretch plays. Change of pace slasher. Subtly alters his rush track to his advantage during the run. Fleet feet constantly on the move. Able to make quality open field cuts. Ball security has been good, with one fumble over the past two years. Showed ability to handle gunner duties in 2018. Nice agility for lateral cut and go. Slippery to tackle. Offers no pass protection help. Hasn't been used for any meaningful pass-catching duties. Unafraid of interior running but is not built for it. Durability could be a concern. Always hurrying and could cut with better patience. Rarely gathers and reassess his run options as an improvisational creator. Not as elusive as expected.

Joshua Kelley,"Physical, downhill runner best-suited for gap-scheme rushing attack. On most carries, it feels like Kelley is playing a game of chicken against defenders when he ducks his head and hits the accelerator into contact. He's going to create some yardage after contact and break tackles here and there, but he tends to become a tackle magnet who is not able to make tacklers miss. He's a tough runner with short-yardage ability and maybe even third-down value. Kelly's strong showing at the Senior Bowl and the NFL Scouting Combine have bolstered his stock and put him squarely on the map as a coveted Day 3 pick. Size and strength runner. Accelerates downhill and runs aggressively behind pads as TD-maker. Absorbs contact and falls forward to finish his runs. Does not back down from handling the hard work. Didn't get enough blocking help but created for himself with power. Strong lower body to dismiss upper body tackles. Runs with square pads. Quick hands to stab and secure high throws. Size and spirit to become decent protection option.  Running style takes a toll on him. Doesn't try to make many people miss. Drops head and rams forward rather than surveying for more moves and yards. Tight hips hinder ability to transition from cut to cut. Forward lean works against him from a balance standpoint. Slow to gather and cut downhill. Below-average start-stop and lateral change of direction. Crowds blockers and lacks feel for the contours of the run lane. Below-average vision to reroute the run.

Jason Huntley,"Lightweight scat-back who offers good versatility as a pass-catcher, change-of-pace runner and quality kick returner. While he has some wiggle and elusiveness, he takes an alarming amount of punishing blows and gets tossed around like a sack of laundry as an inside runner. He will need to pair with a team that utilizes his vision and tempo primarily on stretch plays. His play speed is just average, which hurts him when he becomes too predictable with his choice or rush paths. Huntley runs good routes and could be considered for usage in gadget packages that also take advantage of his ability to work from the slot. Can splash around as a ball-carrier, pass catcher and kick returner. Averaged 7.1 yards per rush in 2019. Quick to process blocking development on stretch plays. Vision and change of direction for fluid run-lane choices. Able to alter run tempo for better elusiveness. His open-field spin move can shake and leave tacklers. Has five career kick returns for touchdowns. Legitimate pass-catching threat from the backfield or the slot. Gets out of breaks with some burst as a route runner.  Angular build with narrow base not suited for inside running. Lacks leg drive to break tackles. Has a tendency to bounce too many runs wide. Better burst quickness than outright speed. Gets caught on dashes to the perimeter. Takes jarring punishment from tacklers. Put the ball on the ground twice right at the goal line.

D'Andre Swift,"Swift possesses the play traits and running style of a skillful NFL veteran and is the latest in an avalanche of talented Georgia backs. Tempo and decisiveness are his calling cards, making him a highly talented inside/outside zone runner. He's a cerebral runner who understands block timing and uses quick-cut agility and rare spatial awareness to read and react to defenses beyond the second level. Swift isn't overly explosive as a home-run hitter and doesn't run with the violence of last year's top running back, Josh Jacobs. He can step right in and provide early stability and production as an efficient, every-down back with Offensive Rookie of the Year potential. Compact build with strong lower body and three-down talent. Understands blocking schemes and trusts his big guys up front. Reads overflowing linebackers on zone carries making early run-lane adjustments. Rare feel and vision in tight quarters as interior runner. Listens to fluidity of the crease and takes what it gives him. Effective jump-cut allows him to press runs deep into the hole. Tremendous feel for spatial relationship. Maintains balance through twists, turns and contact. Gets right on top of tacklers before cutting. Quick to find acceleration after slowing his feet. Can run expanded route tree and separate out of breaks. Hands are soft and sticky as pass-catcher. Willing to step into pass protection duties and has some dog in him. Ball security is well below NFL standards, with a low carries-per-fumble mark. Quicker than fast, lacking home-run burst. Get-away burst to the outside is just average. Doesn't move piles or finish with plus authority. Ends up working harder than other backs to find explosive runs. Will need to learn to use his hands in pass protection.

Jonathan Taylor,"Supremely productive, well-built runner with an all-day, every-day mentality that helped lead him to three Big Ten rushing titles. Taylor runs with bend and burst as an outside runner and has home-run speed once he gets into the open field. He displays an ability to weave around interior traffic but might have evolved into more of a thinker than reactor inside due to fumbling issues and the litany of loaded fronts he faced. His patience and understanding of the where/when of blocks allowed him to thrive in multiple run schemes. He's more body puncher than knockout artist, wearing down his opponents with carry after carry. His traits, toughness and talent should make him an early starter with a solid ceiling and more third-down potential than we saw at Wisconsin. Prototypical height, weight, speed and durability. Hit 200-plus yards 12 times during career. Rarely rushes the run and allows lead blocks to eat. Deep line of scrimmage press for cutback freedom. Sinks, plants and cuts with one-cut talent. Navigates and flows with contours of the run lane. Burst around the corner outpaces pursuit. Former track man with a breakaway gear. Plays with good bend and forward lean. Balances through contact for additional yardage. Possesses talent to make something out of nothing. Chops out legs from under blitzers. Showed some route-running ability against Northwestern. Tallied over 300 touches in all three years. Wear and tear could be a concern for NFL teams. Fumbled 15 times over three years. Occasional hesitation processing interior. Lacks fluid jump-cuts. Slows feet and covers into contact inside at times. Anticipates second-level moves instead of splitting defenders. Not a powerful pile mover in tight quarters.

Cam Akers,"Despite a disappointing win-loss record and a lack of blocking up front, Akers maintained a consistent level of play that represents his football character. He runs with tempo and flow but alters his rush track at a moment's notice when needed. He is elusive but lacking the instant burst of a slasher capable of stacking long runs in a single game. Akers has above-average open-field vision once he's into the second level and looks to run through the tackler's pads as a finisher. He's a three-down option with good feel for finding the crease near the goal line, but ball security needs to improve. He can be Leg 1 or 2 of a tandem rushing attack and is one of the more natural runners in the draft. Compact, rocked-up build with powerful legs. Played behind subpar run blocking and often found his own production. Tough finisher who's able to shred arm tackles and balance through contact. Wicked open-field spin move to slip defender. Instinctive runner with good feel for run-lane development. Multiple cuts and run-lane resets without losing momentum. Eyes and feet work in unison. Former high school quarterback with trick play potential. Sudden feet to elude sudden traffic. Nose for the end zone once he's in range. Open-field vision boosts screen-game value. Has grit needed to handle pass-blocking duties. Ball security could be a concern for teams. Hasn't displayed chunk play explosiveness over three years. Attracts heavy contact rather than slipping it. Wide scan of the terrain can cause brief delays to see openings. May have been conditioned to look for early escapes due to blocking. Productive out of backfield but hands aren't that natural.

Clyde Edwards-Helaire,"Compact, sudden back who runs low to the ground with power and balance to break tackles and the agility to bob, weave and shake them in tight quarters. Edwards-Helaire runs with instinctive eyes and quick-cut foot speed. He doesn't really have tells or tendencies and can alter the rush track when needed, which makes him so unpredictable for defenses. While he can create for himself, he's better off working inside-out as NFL linebackers might be able to outflank him on pure outside runs. He has pop behind his pads but lacks short-yardage size. He has the talent to become a good, three-down back in time, but needs to improve in pass protection. Ball security is outstanding. Runs low to the ground with superb bend and balance. 36 percent of his carries were for first downs or touchdowns in 2019. Can cut-and-go without stopping anywhere on field. Quick gather and cut agility laterally or on downhill flow. Has spin move, elongated jump cut, and sudden double cut in his bag. Makes tacklers miss in a phone booth. Instinctive eyes and feet make him unpredictable. Alters run tempo at times to con flowing linebackers. Squares pads and falls forward to finish. Has instant access to burst and sharp one-cut angles.

J.K. Dobbins,"Good football player who bounced back from a sub-par 2018. Proved he could shoulder a heavy load and rise to the occasion against the best his schedule had to offer. He can make a sudden tackler miss and fits as a one-cut runner, but his running style is more battle axe than buzzsaw as a lunch-pail runner with the fortitude and toughness to wear down defenses. Dobbins isn't going to be that creative back with the wiggle and juice to create something out of nothing, but he has the efficiency, production and third-down value teams covet. Dobbins could land a shared-carries role quickly and has the potential to become a solid NFL starter. Beach body with chiseled, compact build. Big games met with big performances in 2019. Never missed a game and played through pain. Beat on defenses as a high-volume bell-cow in 2019. Steady supply of contact balance to absorb and move forward. Ankle flexion and foot gather for tighter cuts on stretch plays. Talented at slipping inside of overflow pursuit. Good peripheral vision once he's up to the second level. Runs with low, squared pads.

Zack Moss,"Watching Moss' game tape is like watching an exercise in controlled violence on just about every carry, but his vision, balance, patience and wiggle are additional skills that help to make him a well-rounded runner. Personnel evaluators for NFL teams say there is wear and tear that could limit the length of his career. He needs to become more discerning with his physical challenges if he wants to see a second contract. He is a great fit for gap and inside, zone-heavy rushing attacks and could become an effective starter as a middle-round pick. Well-built with power dispersed throughout. Both patient and urgent gears at his disposal. Runs with rare calm in the face of early penetration. Underrated vision to process and game plan beyond the line of scrimmage. Adequate burst inside with feel for the contour of the running lane. Short-stepping running style with elite contact balance. Arm tacklers might want to call in sick.

More likely to elude and punish rather than string moves together. Running style could lead to durability concerns. Had season-ending surgery on meniscus in 2018.

Darrynton Evans,"Slashing outside-zone runner with glide in his stride and ability to run with elusiveness and creativity. Evans is a little undersized and might be viewed as a change-of-pace option, but he appears to have the three-down skill set to handle committee carries. He can run with patience, but has the loose hips and agile feet to plant-and-go in a hurry. He sees the field and does a nice job of setting up and eluding tacklers with lateral cuts or stacked moves. While he's confident in space, Evans lacks the commitment and finishing force to make a living inside the tackles. His third-down and kick-return versatility increases the likelihood that Evans will hear his name called in the middle rounds with a chance to become a solid RB2. Grabbed larger chunks of production pie in both 2018 and 2019. Has talent as one-cut back in outside zone. Runs low and smooth with plus change of direction quickness. Rare ball security with no fumbles in 482 carries. Hips are fluid and loose for short-area swivel. Takes away tackle angles once he's past second level.

AJ Dillon,"Built like a minibus but possessing enough vision and finesse to avoid being pigeon-holed as just a pure power back. Dillon is capable of handling heavy workloads and wearing down defenses, but there is a concern from evaluators that it's taken a physical toll on him. He's a disciplined runner who trusts his blocking scheme and follows his rush track. He's a good one-cut runner with below-average wiggle but natural power to create yards after contact. Dillon will find more space as he faces fewer loaded boxes as a pro, but dropping weight and adding quickness could be the difference between a future as a committee back or starter. Carries weight easily on big, well-proportioned frame. Above-average athletic traits for such a big runner. Went for 150-plus rushing yards in almost 42 percent of his career starts. Finds paydirt, with 39 career rushing touchdowns. Can move piles or leap over them. Absorbs contact like a big linebacker. Trusts the process and follows design of the rush track.

Benjamin thrives when runs go off schedule but also has a habit of taking them off schedule prematurely. His elusiveness is always on display, but he's a competitive, tough runner when it is time to get down. Benjamin needs a spread-based running game that allows for more space and freedom but must become more decisive as an NFL back. He offers value in a dual run-catch capacity on Day 2 (Rounds 2-3). Excellent three-down production as starter. When you think he's tackled, he's not. Eludes, accelerates and escapes. Changes speed to manipulate edge and turn the corner. Eliminates overpursuit with cutbacks. Runs with excellent competitive streak inside/outside. Staccato footwork to slalom around traffic. Hard-nosed, with plenty of pop as finisher. Alters platform, making him a slippery tackle target. Effective pass catcher and hard to guard out of backfield. Knows where to be and makes an effort in pass pro.  Noticeable drop in production from 2018. Could take time adjusting to a pro-style rush attack. Feels unsure when approaching the muck. One-cut opportunities turn into a series of moves. Spends too much time setting up LBs instead of bursting past. Hip tightness restricts sharpness of downhill cuts. Takes on heavy collisions too often. Occasional focus drops on easy catch attempts.

DeeJay Dallas,"Dallas was a high school quarterback who came into Miami as a receiver and converted to running back during the 2017 season. The production is modest and the instincts are a work in progress, but there are flashes of run-lane feel and downhill smoothness that could be a sign of future development. He has size, speed and a surprising amount of pop as a finisher. His contact balance makes him hard to bring down through contact, but he needs to improve his open-field wiggle. He lacks third-down readiness, but his special teams talent should make up for that. The traits and toughness make him an intriguing upside prospect on Day 3. Played WR and RB at Miami. Added bad weight in 2018, but slimmed down in 2019. Instincts and feel for rush track improved during season. Does a nice job of running tacklers into blocks. Plus burst with decent getaway juice at his disposal. Willing accelerator through contact for heavy forward finish. Slippery to tackle and hard to get down. Choppy feet and contact balance to keep runs going. Potential to become a four-phase special-teamer with return talent. Still learning to hone his instincts as a runner. Inconsistent processing and resolving sudden traffic. More one speed than patient in his approach. Below average setting up open-field tacklers on the levels to miss. Still figuring out efficiency of footwork for downhill cuts. Doesn't always know where he needs to be in protection. Take-on technique will need work.

La'Mical Perine,"Backup-caliber running back who fails to dazzle in any particular area, but who does enough of what's asked of him and has the character traits to become a dependable pro. He's most skilled in the early stages of the run, where his sticky feet and quick eyes help him find his initial rush tracks, but his lack of burst and second-level creativity make him more of a grinder than a playmaker. He has the play traits to compete for a backup role in a one-cut scheme, and his special teams experience improves his chances. Prototypical size of today's NFL running back. High-character, hard worker on and off the field. Gets behind the wheel and patiently steers lead blockers into their targets. Plays with decisive eyes and sticky feet for sharp gather and cut. Foot twitch to bound back and forth around early penetration. Understands the physical nature of his job. Low center of gravity allows for additional balance to defeat arm tackles. Intuitive near goal line with ability to spot routes to pay dirt. Experience as core special-teams player in 2018. Rarely drops it as pass-catcher and has potential to get better as blocker. Tends to run with monotonous tempo, allowing linebackers to find him. Lacks desired burst to accelerate both inside and outside. Early shake tends to dissipate once he hits second level. Drops head and plows forward prematurely rather than re-setting rush path at times. Takes on excessive amount of contact for his carry total. Still training eyes to recognize protection duties. Needs more technique work before he can be trusted to protect his quarterback.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.1875675042233496,0.0,0.0,0.060412399574462226,0.0
Anthony McFarland,"McFarland runs hard, but he's not that big and he's not that creative, so he could struggle to find yardage for himself. A high-ankle sprain may have been at the root of his unimpressive 2019 tape, as he showed a little better burst and tackle-breaking ability in 2018, but in both seasons he needed either clear points of entry or to be operating in open space to get it going. His projection can't just rely on a couple of splash performances from 2018. He appears to have low-end backup potential, but it's worth noting that some NFL teams are much higher on him. Better 2018 tape due to high-ankle sprain in 2019. Has build-up speed to run away from tacklers. Had runs of 75, 81, and 52 yards against Ohio State in 2018. Accelerates into contact behind pads. Agility to sidestep foot traffic. Able to stack cuts on top of cuts. Decisive runner between the tackles. Adjusts to off-target throws out of backfield. Capable ball tracker on wheel routes.  Runs on tiptoes on stretch plays. Slow to gather in cut. Lacks desired feel for run lane development. Needs plenty of space to operate. Unable to slow feet and then reignite quickly. Doesn't have bend to unleash lower-body power. Runs hard but has below-average drive through contact. Not enough sand in his pants to trust protection skills.

Ke'Shawn Vaughn,"Comes into the league with NFL size and toughness, but his success could be tied to scheme and blocking up front due to physical limitations. Vaughn is a tight-hipped runner who has issues with stop-start quickness and is unable to stack moves on top of moves. He's not hard to find, but can be hard to tackle. He's best suited to compete as a backup in a one-cut rushing attack from under center where he can build momentum and create yards after contact. His 2018 tape was better than his 2019 season and he appears headed for a middle-round selection. Prototypical size of an early-down running back. Muscular, well-built legs and arms. Scored a touchdown once every 16.5 touches at Vanderbilt. Former high school sprinter with finishing speed in open field. Adequate lateral agility in tight quarters. Consistent production despite suspect blocking up front. Runs with patience as outside zone back. Breaks through arm tackles regularly. Keeps runs alive with leg drive and determination. Plays up to his size and strength as pass blocker.  Vision and ability to create for himself are average. Very tight hips with very tight strides. Can race to the edge, but struggles to flatten around the corner. Takes time to accelerate after slowing feet. Not much ability to avoid contact. More of a ""one move and finish"" type runner. Lacks NFL-level burst to shoot past traffic. Very few carries of 20-plus yards this year.

Raymond Calais,"Change-of-pace back with very good burst but below average size that could limit his NFL suitors. Calais is fairly talented (and courageous) as an inside/outside zone runner, but as a pro, he will likely be considered a gadget back who makes his living in open space. His play speed is what gives him a chance, but he needs to run with better patience to improve his control and elusiveness in the open field. He's not much of a third-down option, but his history as a punt-team gunner works in his favor. Impressive burst to race past second level. Able to take away downhill angles for support safeties. Plenty of juice to threaten perimeter on stretch plays. Change of pace slasher. Subtly alters his rush track to his advantage during the run. Fleet feet constantly on the move. Able to make quality open field cuts. Ball security has been good, with one fumble over the past two years. Showed ability to handle gunner duties in 2018. Nice agility for lateral cut and go. Slippery to tackle. Offers no pass protection help. Hasn't been used for any meaningful pass-catching duties. Unafraid of interior running but is not built for it. Durability could be a concern. Always hurrying and could cut with better patience. Rarely gathers and reassess his run options as an improvisational creator. Not as elusive as expected.

Joshua Kelley,"Physical, downhill runner best-suited for gap-scheme rushing attack. On most carries, it feels like Kelley is playing a game of chicken against defenders when he ducks his head and hits the accelerator into contact. He's going to create some yardage after contact and break tackles here and there, but he tends to become a tackle magnet who is not able to make tacklers miss. He's a tough runner with short-yardage ability and maybe even third-down value. Kelly's strong showing at the Senior Bowl and the NFL Scouting Combine have bolstered his stock and put him squarely on the map as a coveted Day 3 pick. Size and strength runner. Accelerates downhill and runs aggressively behind pads as TD-maker. Absorbs contact and falls forward to finish his runs. Does not back down from handling the hard work. Didn't get enough blocking help but created for himself with power. Strong lower body to dismiss upper body tackles. Runs with square pads. Quick hands to stab and secure high throws. Size and spirit to become decent protection option.  Running style takes a toll on him. Doesn't try to make many people miss. Drops head and rams forward rather than surveying for more moves and yards. Tight hips hinder ability to transition from cut to cut. Forward lean works against him from a balance standpoint. Slow to gather and cut downhill. Below-average start-stop and lateral change of direction. Crowds blockers and lacks feel for the contours of the run lane. Below-average vision to reroute the run.

Jason Huntley,"Lightweight scat-back who offers good versatility as a pass-catcher, change-of-pace runner and quality kick returner. While he has some wiggle and elusiveness, he takes an alarming amount of punishing blows and gets tossed around like a sack of laundry as an inside runner. He will need to pair with a team that utilizes his vision and tempo primarily on stretch plays. His play speed is just average, which hurts him when he becomes too predictable with his choice or rush paths. Huntley runs good routes and could be considered for usage in gadget packages that also take advantage of his ability to work from the slot. Can splash around as a ball-carrier, pass catcher and kick returner. Averaged 7.1 yards per rush in 2019. Quick to process blocking development on stretch plays. Vision and change of direction for fluid run-lane choices. Able to alter run tempo for better elusiveness. His open-field spin move can shake and leave tacklers. Has five career kick returns for touchdowns. Legitimate pass-catching threat from the backfield or the slot. Gets out of breaks with some burst as a route runner.  Angular build with narrow base not suited for inside running. Lacks leg drive to break tackles. Has a tendency to bounce too many runs wide. Better burst quickness than outright speed. Gets caught on dashes to the perimeter. Takes jarring punishment from tacklers. Put the ball on the ground twice right at the goal line. Carries the ball too loosely when approaching interior traffic.",0.0,-0.042687230328953454,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.18957057692673798
Breece Hall,"Will give NFL evaluators early starter vibes with his blend of size, power and creativity. Hall isn't very sudden in tight quarters but gets better as the run play progresses with good vision and an above-average sense for how to beat second-level tacklers. He has surprising build-up speed once he's in the open field but might not have the instant gas to become a plus outside runner. His running style is willful when it needs to be and he's adept at moving the chains on ""got to have it"" short-yardage carries. Hall has full-package, three-down talent with surprisingly soft hands out of the backfield and should find early touches as a Day 2 draft pick with above-average potential.

Kenneth Walker III,"Walker is a compact back with a very powerful, sturdy base. He can find his own yards with twitchy directional change when run-blocking breaks down and possesses plus-rated contact balance to add on to his yardage throughout the game. Walker is a very determined runner who is more reactive than instinctive, which leads to wild shifts in his rush track. He can handle RB1 workload in terms of carries but needs work as a third-down option. Walker would benefit from better rush-track discipline, but his explosiveness and unpredictable style should still lead to success as a future starter.
 
Compact and powerful with the build to handle a full workload.
Scans and picks up run lanes in any direction.
Feet are fast and agile in tight quarters.
Instant one-cut talent with no gather steps needed.

Zamir White,"White is a naturally powerful runner with a lower half that is hard to knock off-balance no matter how clean the shot. He's not very dynamic as a runner but is a two-way creator with lateral jump-cuts to avoid tackles and the power to run through them. He's a wide-base runner who should excel in gap and inside zone schemes but his running style might not lend itself to a long career. He has two ACL tears in his background and is unlikely to play on passing downs, but he's a formidable ""thunder"" back waiting to be paired with a ""lightning"" cohort and will give running games a chance to test the resolve of defenses for four full quarters.

Isaiah Spiller,"Volume-carry running back with good size and talent for starting consideration as a pro. He was slowed, at times, by inconsistent run blocking but was still productive and consistent for much of the 2021 season. He has interior vision and loose hips, allowing him to locate and get to run lanes regardless of traffic. Spiller runs with good elusiveness but stays in that mode a little too long, which can affect his ability to finish with authority. He's a solid back but not overly dynamic and lacks the desired third-down value right now.

Brian Robinson,"Robinson is an absolute physical unit with good feet and power to add yards after contact, but his running style is predictable and somewhat indecisive between the tackles. Building and maintaining momentum doesn't always come easily. He's more fight than flight, but delays in processing and a lack of second-level creativity turn him into more of a road-grader than he needs to be. He is a linear runner who is likely to be utilized as a complementary bulldozer to help wear down defenses, but Robinson might have more potential from sideline to sideline than he receives credit for.

Dameon Pierce,"It's a fun afternoon of tape study watching Pierce play the game like a coiled spring ready to explode on each snap. He's an urgent runner with twitchy downfield burst, tackle-breaking leg drive and outstanding balance through contact. He reads and reacts to block development quickly and creates additional yardage with both power and subtle shiftiness. Pierce was highly productive (16 total touchdowns) in 2021 despite an embarrassingly low usage rate by the coaching staff. He has plenty of tread left on the tires and fits into any run-blocking scheme as a quality future starter or member of a RB tandem.

Kevin Harris,"Big, bruising runner with good vision and the self-awareness to understand that power running is what will butter his bread. His 2021 productivity fell off from 2020, due in part to health issues, shared carries and average South Carolina run blocking. He creates for himself with contact and tackle-breaking talent, but typically drops and finishes against an open-field tackler rather than avoiding him. He's a chain mover with excellent ball security as a battering ram inside. He will be limited as an outside runner and needs to come off the field on passing downs.

James Cook,"Change-of-pace runner with vision and flow but a lack of functional play strength. The younger brother of Vikings running back Dalvin Cook, James has his brother's one-cut talent and ability to stack cuts seamlessly through the second level. However, he is missing his big brother's build, contact balance and toughness between the tackles, which will surely cap expectations and asks from an NFL club. His slashing style fits with outside zone and toss plays. He can also be used as a mismatch option as a pass-catcher. Cook has big-play ability but is unlikely to see his carry count get very high.

Tyler Badie,"Undersized, change-of-pace back with a big heart and pass-catching talent. Despite a lack of desired size, Badie took on a monster workload and produced at a high level. He played in a run scheme heavily tilted to outside zone and is at his best in space, although he's natural and confident in tight run lanes. He's a tough runner but lacks short-yardage leg drive, so his role as a pro could be fairly well-defined as a talented third-down back who can handle an occasional spike in carries if needed.
 
Adequate decisiveness to process the front and hit it.

Pierre Strong,"Instinctive running back with NFL traits and talent to find a home as a committee back or an eventual RB1. Hyper-focused vision provides him a variety of cut options and rush paths but also causes him to overthink his approach at times. Strong is more reactive than manipulative but is quite impressive with his spatial awareness and ability to slalom around bodies on a smooth, linear pathway without slowing his roll. He struggles when forced to slow his feet and make early cuts. He needs a north/south run scheme where he can square his pads and find his rhythm quickly. Strong lacks third-down value at this time, but has shown enough to believe it could be in his future.
 
Big-play threat with 10 career rushing TDs of 50-plus yards.

Kyren Williams,"Fiery team leader and combative runner who leaves it all out on the field. Williams has been a worker bee with a willingness to do the heavy lifting on all three downs and has premium third-down talent both in blitz pickup and as a route-runner out of the backfield. The Patriots' usage of James White, Dion Lewis and Brandon Bolden might be the blueprint for how to utilize Williams in the NFL.

Rachaad White,"Running back with size and senior year production, but the tape is more average than exciting. White is a tight-hipped runner lacking desired lateral agility and burst after changing direction. He has a tendency to be slowed or stopped by first-level tacklers but is a more natural runner once he gets up to the second level. He fails to show enough creativity to escape the ""gets what is blocked"" tag, but he does run with adequate vision. His lack of breakaway speed and limited special teams background won't help his chances, so he needs to shine early in camp to give himself an opportunity to make a team as a RB3.

Three-down workload of carries and catches.

Tyler Allgeier,"Well-built, highly productive zone-scheme runner with impressive vision and feel for the job. Allgeier is smooth and instinctive with one-cut talent. He effectively navigates the ebbs and flows of run lane development. He's more agile than twitchy and relies on his ability to quickly process. While he sees it clearly, his pace and burst can be a little hit-or-miss and might allow for NFL defenses to prevent the chunk play. Allgeier is clearly talented as a runner but will need to prove his explosiveness. He offers very little third-down value right now and could be tabbed as a solid backup in a move-based rush attack.

Ty Chandler,"His impressive 2021 should pump some life into Chandler's draft stock. After sharing carries at Tennessee, Chandler took a bigger bite out of the pie at North Carolina, seeing spikes in yardage, yards per carry and touchdown production. He's a smooth strider who can become a little disjointed when processing and attacking the blocking scheme. Chandler needs to turn up the play speed in the early stages to attack the fleeting run lanes he will see in the pros. In a deep running back draft, Chandler's ability to catch passes and return kicks should help improve his chance of being selected on Day 3.

Snoop Conner,"Rocked up runner with aggressive disposition and relatively low mileage on his tires. Conner is a scheme-versatile runner, which could help him as he transitions to the next level. He's more than willing to choose violence on every snap but rarely allows that mindset to prevent him from seeking out less-trafficked pathways with his vision. He will run himself into some tackles because of his red-hot tempo, but ironically, he's a patient and highly effective short-yardage back. Conner's disappointing showing at the NFL Scouting Combine is hard to ignore, though, and could hurt his standing with evaluators. Conner has three-down talent and projects as a good committee back with the frame to carry a workload if needed.

Jerome Ford,"Well-built back with NFL size and athletic ability but the vision and creativity are just OK. Ford lacks the desired instincts and recognition of run-lane development, but he's fast, strong and athletic. He has the tools to find yards with those traits. He's a talented, explosive option out of the backfield with soft hands and the speed to mismatch linebackers out in space.

Trestan Ebner,"Swiss Army Knife with size, speed and versatility to potentially help in three different phases for a team. Ebner is a former all-state prep receiver whose mismatch potential out of the backfield should rank as his most endearing play trait. He's been a productive kick returner with open-field vision and build-up speed to hit big plays. Despite his size, he's underwhelming as a runner and struggles to play with consistent decisiveness and aggression in that role.

Hassan Haskins,"Big runner who is much more workmanlike than dynamic with the ball in his hands. In his lone season as a lead back, Haskins' downhill, physical style was well-paired with the ""cloud of dust"" rushing philosophy for Michigan. He might be forced to run with less patience and more urgency to stay a step ahead of NFL pursuit. While he played the role he was cast into, there were signs (versus Penn State) that he might have some potential as an inside/outside back. Haskins won't make a living out of dodging tacklers, and big chain-movers who lack wiggle are not hard to find. He still has a chance to stick in the NFL if he lands in the right situation.

Isiah Pacheco,"Hard-charging, high-energy runner with three-down size and potential to compete for a roster spot as a late-round selection. Pacheco plays the game like a race car with no brakes. His feet never stop moving and his furious tempo creates opportunities but also limits his ability to set up defenders and force missed tackles. He processes the front fairly quickly and has the agility to re-adjust his running lanes to create something out of nothing, but he also has a tendency to bounce runs wide too frequently. Pacheco plays the game with an NFL demeanor and could give himself an even better chance of becoming an RB2/3 if he can step up his pass protection and third down value.

Robinson is well-built with a compact lower half and pairs a low center of gravity with agile feet. There are elements of both fight and flight in his running style, but defenders can never be quite sure what they are going to get. He’s a capable inside/outside runner with unique footwork to stack moves and reset pathways, but can plow into tacklers at a moment’s notice using elite contact balance to keep the run rolling. He might need to dial back efforts to search out big runs so frequently and take what is there a little more often to keep from getting bogged down.

De'Von Achane,"Finding a player comparison for Achane is challenging because he has blazing speed and is fearless as an inside runner, but is very small by NFL standards. He has the creativity and burst to create chunk plays but durability concerns will likely limit the amount of carries a team is willing to give him. Achane can be a complementary slasher with the ability to mismatch coverage out of the backfield or from the slot. However, he’s simply too talented and explosive as a runner to be confined to gadget duty. History does not favor backs his size, but his playmaking potential could be too tough to pass up on Day 2 of the draft.

Zach Charbonnet,"Upright runner with outstanding body composition and consecutive seasons of impressive production for the Bruins. Charbonnet is a bit of a long-strider with slightly below average foot quickness. He is much more effective when allowed to open up and build downhill momentum. He can slip tackles in the open field but lacks the first-level wiggle to get too cute. He’s inconsistent in processing defensive fronts quickly but can be a hammer into and through contact when he has a clear point of entry. Charbonnet is a talented third-down option as both a blocker and pass-catcher. He could be viewed as a Day 2 value with three-down potential.

Eric Gray,"Decisive, creative runner with the size and skill set for three-down consideration on the pro level. Gray won’t be a home run hitter in the open field, but his short-area burst and oily hips open access to the entire field, with cuts coming suddenly and at unpredictable angles. He’s a less powerful finisher than his size might indicate and needs to keep from spilling runs wide unnecessarily. He is a reliable threat out of the backfield with soft hands and a willingness to block. Gray has the potential to find work quickly as a three-down backup with future starter potential.

Tyjae Spears,"Spears has the size of a change-of-pace back, but he needs to play with more consistent explosiveness, as he’s unlikely to offer the versatility typically expected from a player in that role. He’s coming off an extremely productive and consistent season as Tulane’s RB1, though. He runs with good bend, average vision and the patience to use lead blockers to his advantage. Spears possesses modest creativity and power through the line of scrimmage but becomes more elusive once he’s up to the second level.

DeWayne McBride,"Productive runner with the physical/athletic attributes that could create an upward trajectory in the right situation. McBride is experienced and comfortable running in all blocking schemes. He’s smooth-hipped and runs with a good blend of shiftiness, and power. He would benefit from a quicker tempo and decisiveness inside. He must eliminate ball security issues or he could end up falling out of favor quickly. McBride’s lack of third down value could hurt his draft slotting, but his upside is worth a Day 3 selection.

Tank Bigsby,"Bigsby is an upright runner with a strong, angular frame. He runs with plus burst and can create yards even when the blocking is insufficient. Bigsby runs with a nice blend of elusiveness and power, and he can quickly process movements of the defense. Fumbling has been a concern in the past, and he might not be much help on third downs or special teams. His size, creativity and quickness could create an opportunity for teams to pair Bigsby with another back to form an effective tandem in a zone-scheme rushing attack.

Chase Brown,"Volume ball-carrier with a compact frame and high-end stamina to wear defenses down. Brown is less slasher than he is a between-the-tackles grinder. He needs to prove he can be an effective outside runner to help widen the field. He’s natural and agile as a one-cut runner and has the receiving talent to make plays out of the backfield. He’s a bit of a one-note runner but could compete for a three-down backup role with a limited ceiling.

Kendre Miller,"The size and production will check important boxes, but Miller’s lack of tempo and explosiveness between the tackles could turn him into a grinder against the speed of NFL defenses. His restricted stride length provides greater control to cut early in the run, but it works against him when he needs to hit the gas and stride past linebackers. He has the size and strength to keep runs moving though contact, although he could be an even better run finisher. His third-down value is relatively low, so he will need to sell himself as an early down backup on the next level.

Roschon Johnson,"Power back with bruising frame who fits the football cliche of “tough, smart and dependable.” Johnson isn’t overly creative and lacks the juice to hit quick-closing NFL holes. He needs it blocked up so he can get downhill and uncork his power on the second level. While his lack of suddenness makes him somewhat limited as a runner, he will be better at stuffing blitzers than many of the No. 3 backs currently in the league. Johnson might be fighting off competition every year in camp, but his toughness and four-phase special teams value could give him an advantage.

Kenny McIntosh,"McIntosh is best suited for a complementary role that allows him to explore the flanks of the offense instead of trying to pound and create between the tackles. He lacks the vision to recognize and exploit opportunities quickly and the elusiveness to dart in and out of developing run lanes. He’s more than capable of finding big runs over the tackles and becomes a more physical finisher as the run progresses. McIntosh has excellent hands and the potential to mismatch coverages when isolated out of the backfield. He could become a RB2 with full-time third-down reps.

Deuce Vaughn,"Vaughn’s playing style is similar to that of former NFL running back Jacquizz Rodgers, but Rodgers was much heavier than Vaughn at a similar height. Despite the versatility, production and durability, teams might focus on his lack of size. However, he sees the field clearly, is fearless between the tackles, possesses quality contact balance and finds his way into the end zone as a runner and receiver. Vaughn has an uphill climb ahead of him, but his history of consistent, high-end production makes the climb to success seem achievable.

He has the size and mentality to do the dirty work between the tackles, but it could be a challenge for him to get to and through the hole quickly in the NFL.

Evan Hull,"Compact, muscular runner with below-average explosiveness but decent downhill power. Hull’s lack of suddenness and foot quickness to quickly get in and out of cuts allows defenders to track him down. He needs to play with as much downhill movement as possible, so he will need a quality offensive line in front of him to succeed. He’s a very capable route-runner and pass-catcher but he needs to improve in pass protection for consideration as a third-down option. Hull might need the perfect team fit to stick around on a roster long-term.

Jonathon Brooks,"The comparison of Brooks to former Longhorn Jamaal Charles might feel lazy to some, but he has similar size and traits as a runner. Brooks' limited collegiate carries could be seen as a balancing agent against the fact he's coming off an ACL tear. He's agile and smooth working from cut to cut and is likely to improve his feel for reading blocks and setting up defenders as he gains experience. Brooks has the wiggle and know-how to create yardage in tight quarters or in space but is efficient finishing runs when it's time. He has good burst but can be a little hesitant to punch the gas between the tackles until he sees clear points of entry, and he isn't a physical run finisher. Brooks is a runner on an upward trajectory. He's a good pass catcher with three-down potential who should fit nicely as an early starter for zone-heavy teams. 
Tires should be full of tread, given that he has just 238 collegiate carries to his name.

Jaylen Wright,"Explosive back with good size and breakaway speed. Wright’s running style is more linear than free-flowing, which limits his cut smoothness and elusiveness on the second level. His vision and aggression as an interior runner are just average, but that won’t stop him from putting yards on the stat sheet. He regularly bounced runs wide and beat the pursuit around the corner, so a move to a stretch-based running attack would be a natural fit, allowing his speed to shine. He’s capable of running with power, but he will default into finesse at times. Wright’s big-play potential and talent as a pass catcher should make him a Day 2 target as a future starter.

Trey Benson,"Big back who might need to table his desires to be an elusive runner and adopt a more physical, decisive approach as a pro. Benson had just two seasons of collegiate wear and tear, but he only hit the 20-carry mark in one game. He runs with good knee-bend, agility and contact balance but takes too long to process the front and hit holes between the tackles. He has creative athleticism but lacks creative vision, so he would be wise to keep more runs on track and finish with consistent authority rather than searching for greener grass.

Frankly, some of his South Carolina tape from 2022 felt more exciting than his 2023 USC film, despite the higher yardage-per-carry mark in 2023. While he ran with improved patience and set up blockers more diligently in '23, he ran with a greater sense of urgency the year prior and proved he could create explosive plays without as much help from his offensive line. Lloyd runs with slightly below-average vision but has the juice to play the role of ""chunk-play slasher"" and dangerous open-field pass catcher. Lloyd is a low-mileage prospect, and the scope of his role will obviously depend on scheme fit. 
Displayed improved tempo and ability to set up blocks in 2023.
Marries NFL-caliber burst with adequate contact pop to fall forward.
Twitchy feet and wide base, allowing access to sudden lateral cuts.
Uses burst and free hand to swat away angle tackles around the corner.
Possesses natural timing in making upfield cuts on wide-flowing runs.
Speed and shake to torment open-field tacklers as a pass-catching option.

Tyrone Tracy Jr.,"Tracy was a full-time running back for only one year but had exciting flashes all over his tape. He’s a bendy, rhythmic runner who sees and traverses the interior run lanes like he built the maze. He creates additional yardage with a blend of elusiveness, power and a willful desire to maximize each run, but he will need to curb his eagerness to bounce runs wide when it’s time to finish and move to the next snap. While he’s still honing his skills as a runner, his ability to handle gadget runs and threaten linebackers out of the backfield could get him on the field early on. Tracy will be an older rookie, but his versatility and burgeoning talent as a complementary runner should open evaluators’ eyes to what he could become as a pro. 
Versatility with starting background at receiver and running back.
Loose hips and wide base allow sharp cuts and change of direction.
Glides with consistent pace and processing to find his pathways.
Long strides help him get to the corner on outside runs ahead of pursuit.

Capable kick returner and cover man on special teams.
 
Still learning to run with discipline to the play design.

Ray Davis,"Three-down back with adequate blend of toughness between the tackles and production out of the backfield. Davis can be a tad indecisive at times but did a much better job of toggling between urgent and patient in his lone season at Kentucky. The vision is fairly average, and he's not going to scare NFL defenses with his speed, but he does alter his pacing to create openings, and he'll finish with some thud behind his pads. Ultimately, he'll need to step up his pass protection to be trusted as a third-down option. Davis' compact frame, toughness and ability to catch the football could make him a middle-round option as a three-down backup with the ability to play a larger role in time. 
Runs behind his pads, falling forward after delivering a blow.
Ran with much better patience behind lead blockers in 2023.
Florida game looked like teaching tape, with 280 rush yards and three TDs.
Uses slow-and-go pacing to distract the edge and open the corner.
Catches with soft hands and has ability to shake or break tackles.
 
Hip tightness slows ability to gather and cut on outside runs.
Unsure eyes cause small foot-stutters before hitting the gas.

Will Shipley,"Versatile running back with talent as a runner, receiver and kick returner. Shipley possesses early speed, allowing him to whip through creases and outrun linebackers to the corner. He’s a flexible runner who reads up to the linebackers and curates his runs with a feel for both defensive positioning and run lane development. He can balance through contact but is unlikely to move NFL piles. Shipley does a nice job of setting up opponents from anywhere on the field and has the agility to hop and hurdle over bodies. He’s not a workhorse and still has work to do in order to solidify himself as a third-down option, but the athletic talent and skill level could create an early pathway into a spot as a productive RB2. 
Standout football, lacrosse and track athlete in high school.
Quality acceleration early in the run and stacks cuts instinctively. 
Maximizes interior space by cutting very tight off the lineman’s hip.
Sets up tacklers to miss with his feet and eyes.

Blake Corum,"Compact runner with average size, outstanding contact balance and a rare talent for finding and fitting into small crevices for short-yardage conversions and touchdowns. Corum is a bit of a one-speed runner lacking sizzle and wiggle but gets it downhill with timing and finishes runs with good forward lean. He has the hard-hat mentality to handle heavy workloads and can exploit defenses that fatigue or miss their run fits. The talent doesn't stand out on its own, but he's strong, competitive and team-oriented with exceptional football character. He can catch it when needed and is above average in picking up the blitz, which could earn him status as a three-down backup with a chance to find early carries as an RB2/3. 
Exceptional production over the last two years.
Feels lane development and works toward the opening.
Hits the run north-south when it's time to go.
Absorbs second-level contact with impressive balance
Quick to process and sidestep early penetration.
Able to add yards after catch out of the backfield.

Isaac Guerendo,"The transfer out of Wisconsin is an ascending running back prospect who was finally able to get enough carries to show what he's capable of. Guerendo is built like a prototypical Badger runner, with a thick, well-proportioned frame. He was a much more decisive runner in 2023, but his cut-and-go burst is fairly average. He's not sudden but runs with appropriate elusiveness, using subtle side-steps to continue the run's downhill momentum. He can catch it out of the backfield and protect his quarterback, making him a suitable three-down backup. Guerendo's size, skill set and demeanor are built for an NFL workload, and he could sneak into a bigger role in the future if he continues to progress. 
Impressive blend of size, agility and toughness.
Ran with improved decisiveness and confidence in his reads in 2023.
Subtle lateral shifts to bounce around bodies through first two levels.
Drops his pads and plows through early arm tacklers.
Defensive backs melt right off of his powerful legs on outside runs.

Braelon Allen,"Allen's splashy entry into college football had evaluators excited about what the end product might look like, but now there are more questions than answers. Allen has rare size on an imposing frame, and his production is nothing to scoff at. Evaluators will need to rely more heavily on his 2022 tape, where he ran with better decisiveness and instincts in a pro-style running attack. He's built to be a banger but needs to embrace a consistently physical style, as he lacks the footwork and hips to elude defenders with finesse. Allen will compete for a role as a two-down backup but could bolster his chances for success if he plays at a lighter weight, to improve his quickness. 
Enormous runner with overbearing, athletic build and impressive production.
In 2021 and 2022, showed he could trust his eyes and run with more decisiveness than he did in 2023.
Can play bumper cars with tacklers in space to add up yards after contact.
Has build-up speed in the open field and throws his stiff-arm like a boxer's jab.
Instinctive in short yardage, with high success rate on short-yardage carries.
Good understanding of protection duties and has size to square and stop the blitz.

Would like to see more ferocity finishing runs to send messages.
Slow to accelerate after a cut and lacks general escapability.

Isaiah Davis,"Brinks-truck runner with the size and power to collide through first contact and create additional yards. Davis is a naturally physical player due to his size but also possesses the bend and footwork to create alternate pathways when needed. He will need to ramp up his decisiveness and hit holes more quickly to thrive through the step up in competition. Davis has limited speed to widen NFL defenses and will need to run with more downhill focus. He has the potential to play all three downs and should be in consideration in the middle rounds. 
Well-built frame includes flexible lower body and nimble feet.
Patient and capable following his blocks as inside or outside runner.
Feet chop through reads and contact to keep runs from stalling out.

Audric Estimé,"Thickly muscled runner capable of wearing out defenses through a heavier workload. There were times Estimé played too slowly when forced to process moving pieces up front, but he showed a greater willingness to cut it loose as the season progressed. He’s naturally powerful with adequate foot agility. Estimé doesn’t have the bend to be a one-cut runner but can make reactive cuts to sudden tacklers near the line of scrimmage. If he can hit the gas with a heavier foot, he’ll continue to break tackles and maximize yardage after contact. He’s a better weapon out of the backfield than he might get credit for being, and he could check into the league as part of a two-headed running attack with the ability to shine near the goal line. 
Can make sudden, reactive cuts to elude a closing tackler.
Agile feet to hop over or side-step foot traffic and keep the run alive.

Dylan Laube,"Do-it-all small-school prospect with versatility and production that could create a roster advantage for him in the future. Laube's pro potential will likely be tied to how a team uses him. While he can be an efficient zone-scheme runner, he lacks the sudden burst and elusiveness needed as a pro. However, he's a very capable pass-catcher with the ability to run a variety of routes out of the backfield or from the slot. While Laube won't blow NFL teams away as a runner, his potential to return kicks and compete for a role on third downs should give him a leg up in a battle for a roster spot. 
Posted considerable production across all phases of involvement.
Runs efficient one-cut tracks with lowered pads and short strides.

Rasheen Ali,"Ali's tape is a fun watch. He's a loose-limbed runner with a blend of instincts and agility that create an admirable rate of consistency relative to the inconsistency of the blocking in front of him. He does a nice job of reading his blocks and shifting speeds to get where he needs to go, but his wiggle and run strength are just average by NFL standards. Ali doesn't appear to have enough acceleration or speed to rush away from speedy defenders, but he is a natural one-cut back. His touchdown production and third-down ability could improve his chances of finding work as an RB3. 
Knee-bender with ideal one-cut acceleration for stretch plays.
Instinctive and fluid to read and react to block development.

Keilan Robinson,"Robinson could be in a tough spot, as he will likely need to prove to teams that he can help in multiple areas in order to make a roster. He's a bendy runner with easy agility when the ball is in his hands. He might be considered too small to handle a backup role, and teams might question whether he has the physical traits for versatility on special teams. However, he's good at what he does, which is eluding tacklers in space and creating opportunities as a pass catcher and kick returner. He's talented, but might have a difficult task convincing teams that he can handle a variety of roles.

Jase McClellan,"Steady three-down running back with the size and skill set that should create a roster opportunity for him. McClellan lacks explosiveness but gets it done with above-average vision and know-how. He's quick to process his lane choice and smooth getting from cut to cut. He has good-not-great burst and appears to be better suited for gap and inside-zone runs. He runs with excellent pad level and loose hips, creating impressive contact balance to extend runs through contact. The numbers don't shine in the passing game, but he's very capable of handling all aspects of third-down football. He's an instinctive runner with three-down talent who could end up outplaying his draft slotting on the right team.

Bucky Irving,"Compact and willful, Irving is deeply committed to each run his play-caller trusts him with. He punches above his weight class with excellent contact balance and leg drive to fight through tackles and squeeze every yard out of the run. However, Irving showed a concerning lack of explosiveness at the NFL Scouting Combine. He is frequently in a rush and would rather run through a wall than around it but he does have the agility to make tacklers miss with wide, lateral cuts when he runs with better patience. Irving isn’t ready for NFL protection duties and is a little tight as a route runner, but he catches the ball cleanly. Irving is missing ideal size and explosiveness, which could land him somewhere in the middle rounds of the draft as an average backup.

Kimani Vidal,"Sawed-off running back with muscular frame and truckload of touches over the last two seasons. The production looks good, but the work was hard as his offensive line struggled with consistency in 2023. He lacks quality burst and elusiveness between the tackles and has trouble outrunning pursuit when plays flow wide. He can get what is blocked and can be tough to get down once in the open field. He’s a plus pass catcher but might not be good enough in protection to warrant third-down value. Vidal could be an underdog to make a roster.

Jawhar Jordan,"Small running back with thin lower half who plays much tougher than his size would indicate. Unlike most smaller backs, Jordan isn't sudden or explosive. He can be a step slow through the line of scrimmage and isn't going to be much of an ""added yardage back"" with power or wiggle. However, Jordan runs with good vision and great processing, making smart cuts and taking the most efficient routes he can. He can compete for third-down reps and has above-average talent as a kick returner. The lack of size will hurt his draft slotting, but he has a shot when he gets into a camp.

Sione Vaki,"Gamer who does whatever is necessary to help his team win. Vaki carries a thick frame with good upper-body power and heavy hands. He took on carries to help his team when it was stung by injuries, but he’s not an NFL running back. He’s a conscientious tackler who is careful to center up and launch his attack only when he’s in realistic striking position. He is overmatched in coverage and struggles when plays roll downfield.

Productive tackler with a nose for the ball on coverage teams.
Works eyes from quarterback to the route as split safety.
Heavy hands send jarring punch into blockers’ attempts.
Comes to balance and makes himself wide as open-field tackler.
Patient to launch tackle tries only when he has target locked in.
 
Backpedal is sluggish and fails to gain enough ground.
Struggles to flip hips and run in phase with the route.
Can be exploited when tasked with man coverage duties.
Short arms and limited athleticism shrink his range as a tackler.

Ashton Jeanty,"Jeanty plays a position that has become devalued on draft day, but his unique talent and the resurgence of the run game in the NFL should force teams to reconsider that factor when weighing his value. He’s the ultimate yardage creator, with the talent and skill set to succeed independent of the quality of his blocking. Jeanty’s speed forces linebackers to flow hard outside, creating cutback lanes and chunk runs, while his vision, balance and elusiveness get it done along the interior. The threat of what he can do on the ground should create ideal play-action opportunities for his team, allowing his next play-caller to, say, unburden a young quarterback or any other passer being asked to shoulder too much of the offense. He’s compact and muscular, but there could be some minor concern surrounding his massive workload in 2024. This top-flight running back is capable of becoming the face of an offense in a league where the pendulum might be swinging back to the running game. Jeanty has future All-Pro talent. 
Runs low to the ground with a wide base, fast feet and good vision.
Trusts play design and won’t come off the track without reason.
Picks up momentum and danger with every step he takes.
Instant burst limits time for defenders to read and react.
Creates yardage with a rare trio of wiggle, power and speed.

Thwarts tacklers and re-ignites the run with contact balance and leg drive.
Taps the gas and skips past tacklers in short spaces when needed.
Plays fast and maintains his pace through cuts and change of direction.
Consistently creates magic with cutbacks as a zone runner.
 
2024 workload bordered on the absurd, with 374 carries, including 279 over the final nine games.
Tight hips limit ability to make sharp, downhill cuts.

TreVeyon Henderson,"Henderson is capable of starring on third downs or biting off a bigger chunk as a three-down option. He has average size but above-average juice with good acceleration. He’s an average decision-maker inside and is not overly creative once confronted by the defense, but he has the pacing and subtle shiftiness to excel as an outside runner. He might be the best pass-protecting running back in this draft and is more than capable as a pass-catcher. Henderson isn’t Jahmyr Gibbs, but he can operate in a similar role for teams looking to add a more dynamic player to their running back room. 
Reads both levels on stretch plays and presses runs tight to blocker's hip.
Slides from gap to gap with twitchy lateral movements.
Accelerates into build-up speed that makes him tough to catch.
Rhythmic in and out of cuts and hasn’t fumbled in three years.
Shakes off angle tackles and drops pads to deliver big contact at the finish.
Sorts, centers and strikes like an offensive lineman in protection.
Displayed route-running potential against Purdue in 2024.
Soft hands make him a safety valve out of the backfield for quarterbacks.
 
Slightly undersized to take on a heavier workload.
Plays fast but is primarily a one-speed runner.
Average vision inside will lead him into trafficked areas.
Not much creativity to conjure yardage in tighter spaces.
Catches too much contact through the line of scrimmage.

Omarion Hampton,"High-volume battering ram with a three-ingredient recipe of size, strength and aggression. 
Hampton is a linear runner lacking creativity and wiggle, but once the gas is engaged, he runs like a downhill truck whose brake lines have been cut. He has the base, balance and power to batter tacklers and reignite runs after contact but he fails to recognize alternative run lanes that offer easier paths and more yardage. He needs to work on his pass protection but can create positive plays on swing passes and screens. Hampton is a tone-setting future starter who can handle a heavy workload, but he absorbs rare levels of heavy contact that could create durability or longevity issues if he doesn’t learn to pick and choose his battles. 
Big back with an impressive, chiseled physique.
Access to a sudden lateral jump-cut to elude penetration.
Displays adequate burst as an off-tackle runner.
Has the hips and feet to stack downhill moves.
Runs square and drives through tacklers with good contact balance.
Willful with the ability to go get must-have yards with force.
Requires gang tackling to keep an ember from relighting.
Capable option on swing passes and screens.
 
One-speed, long-strider runner with limited one-cut ability.
Slow vision to diagnose lane development and change run tracks.
Bangs into blockers and lacks adequate elusiveness.
Too eager to leave his feet and take abuse in the air.
Below-average speed to win wide and turn the corner.

Dylan Sampson,"Compact back with good instincts and run-after-contact ability that propelled him to stardom in his lone season as a starter. Sampson separates himself from other backs in the class with an impressive feel for timing, spacing and blocking scheme. He sees lane development in real time and is disciplined to stay on the designed track, but he can flip a switch and improvise when traffic mounts. He can wiggle around tacklers or break free from their grasps. Ball security and pass protection improvement will be early priorities for his next coaching staff. Sampson plays with the instincts of a seasoned veteran and has the talent to build on what he started in 2024.  
Good one-cut and jump-cut talent to get the run rolling.
Presses the line and cuts it tight off the blocker's hip.
Understands blocking scheme and feels run-lane development.
Instinctive inside runner with subtle cuts to avoid the heat.
Respects the run track but can bounce it wide if needed.
Excellent burst and speed to run outside or hit chunk plays.
Uses a “Madden spin” and lower-body power to shake off tacklers.
Efficient short-yardage back with a nose for the paint.
 
Below-average size for workload asked of him.
Better vision on inside zone than as an outside runner.
Allowed defenders to rip the ball out of his hands.
Used infrequently as a pass catcher.
Uncertain when sifting through blitzes in protection.

Quinshon Judkins,"Judkins is a productive runner possessing good size and great contact aggression. His running style is both urgent and a bit chaotic. He runs with good burst inside but is more collision-based than wiggle-oriented when maneuvering through the lane. He’s efficient on runs outside the tackle box, but he has a tough time outracing pursuit to create explosive runs. He is wired and built for a heavier carry count and short-yardage success, but the disparity in yards per carry between Judkins and TreVeyon Henderson, despite running behind the same line, is telling. Judkins might need to be paired with a slasher, but he has the ingredients needed to become a three-down RB1. 
Prototypical size, aggression and play strength.
Presses the run deep into the line before cutting.
Limits stride length when he looks for better control of his cut quickness.
Outside runs feature patience, decisiveness and efficiency in space.
Sudden burst to rush past arm traffic at the line of scrimmage.
Runs with NFL-caliber physicality and falls forward as a finisher.
Touchdown monster with a rushing score for every 16.4 carries over three seasons.
Has the dog in him for tough take-ons in blitz pickup.
 
Hips are too tight for sharp angles as a one-cut runner.
Lacks spatial awareness for smooth trips through the interior.
Below-average speed to outrace pursuit and stack explosive runs.
Averaged less than four yards per carry in five of nine conference games during the 2024 regular season.

Bhayshul Tuten,"If you spend too much time focusing on the small inconsistencies of Tuten’s college game, you run the risk of overlooking the match he is for the pro game. He’s an explosive athlete with average size but a compact frame. He has elite straight-line speed and easy hips to make sudden cuts and turns. He’s fairly average at reading the front and running with early decisiveness but creates with wiggle, power and speed. Drops and fumbles are a concern, but runners with his contact balance, power and home run speed put tremendous stress on defenses over four quarters. Tuten could become a starting-caliber back with three-down value. 
Rare track speed makes him a threat to go yard on any snap.
Good plant-and-cut wiggle to side step open-field tacklers.
Tough runner able to absorb contact and deliver punishment.
Powerful hips tear through arm and angle tackles on second level.
Can rocket around the corner and beat the pursuit angles by linebackers. 
Scrappy “square them up” mentality in pass protection.
Able to elude the first tackler and find the sticks on swing passes and leak-outs.
Big-play potential in a kick-return role.
 
Ball security was an issue in both seasons at Virginia Tech.
Lacks decisiveness and feel for lane development. 
Would like to see him process and burst more quickly.
Will bounce a run wide instead of trusting and working behind a lead block.
Needs to learn to avoid the hellish contact and collisions he frequently takes on.
Has trouble securing passes that are outside of his frame.

Kaleb Johnson,"Johnson is built like a bruiser, but his style is more finesse, preferring to win with tempo and decisiveness. He keeps his runs on time and on track while allowing blockers to do their job. He’s not overly aggressive, but he has the size and strength to break tackles and grab extra yards at the finish. He runs with below-average creativity and cut quickness but has consistent linear play speed to pop chunk runs. He can catch, but his three-down value takes a hit because of his struggles in pass pro. Johnson’s traits and running style make him a projectable fit in a two-back system with the upside to take on a bigger chunk down the road. 
Good size with an athletic, proportional frame.
Handled heavier workload and produced at a high level.
Running style tends to be patient but decisive.
Operates with consistent tempo and a trust for the run track.
Keeps feet active while reading block development.
Brushes off second-level tacklers and piles up explosive carries.
Capable of bringing in off-frame throws.
 
Average bend leads to an upright running style.
Lacks sudden acceleration after feet are slowed.
Below-average contact aggression for his size.
Not enough lateral agility for sharp back-side cuts across the grain.
Unlikely to be trusted with third-down protection duties.

Jacory Croskey-Merritt,"Eligibility issues sidelined Croskey-Merritt for all but one game in 2024, but his skills were on full display at the East-West Shrine Bowl in January. He’s a quick processor with adequate size and impressive cut quickness to find yards in a crowded workspace. He has one-cut talent and the ability to break runs sharply across the grain when necessary. He finishes runs with purpose, too. He’ll be a 24-year-old rookie with below-average third-down value, but his talent and creativity pop quickly on tape and give him a chance to become a good RB2 at the next level. 
Reads defenses to second level and quickly processes/responds.
Outstanding stop, cut and accelerate mechanism to elude in tight spaces.
Runs with block anticipation and a feel for cutting off of the blocker’s hip.
Able to snap off one-cut runs at crisp angles.
Delivers force into contact without losing base balance.
Highly competitive finishes squeeze every yard from the run.

Jordan James,"Physical runner with a compact frame and lower center of gravity. James punches way above his weight class when it comes to breaking tackles and doling out punishment, but his ability to suddenly cut and change direction should not be minimized. He plays fast but lacks patience to allow his blocks to develop. Early success on runs over the tackle can eventually lead to collision finishes, where he ducks his eyes instead of seeking to find a cut or move. James lacks finesse, but his ability to get tough yards could create draft value as a RB3 with a chance to develop into a larger role in time. 
Hits sudden lateral cuts to elude early penetration from the defense.
Instant stop-start and change-of-direction quickness.
Absorbs and runs through contact with powerful lower half.
Looks to demolish defensive backs who try to tackle him.

Cam Skattebo,"Carnage creator with a compact frame and elite contact balance. Skattebo can break through second-level tacklers and careen off of bodies for extended yards after contact. He reads his blocks quickly and is more elusive in the early stages of the run than he’s probably given credit for. He lacks top-end speed and will have to contend with bigger, better tacklers on the next level. Skattebo’s effectiveness as a receiver out of the backfield should add to his draft value. His physicality and edge should bode well for him as a complementary back with three-down value who is capable of helping an offense wear down the defense. 
Built low to the ground with a compact, muscular frame.
Runs with excellent footwork in tight quarters.
Makes sudden, sharp alterations to the run lane when needed due to penetration.
Bursts into his top speed fairly quickly. 
Either breaks defender’s tackle or makes them feel his force.

Trevor Etienne,"Low-mileage back with modest production and average explosiveness but legitimate three-down versatility. He lacks the speed and power of his brother, the Jacksonville Jaguars’ Travis Etienne, but Trevor wins with vision, elusiveness and efficiency. He is capable inside and does a nice job of staying tight to the track but could struggle to get tough yards. He runs with average burst wide but sets up tacklers and gets in and out of cuts without losing speed. Etienne catches with sticky hands, evades tacklers in space and has a very good understanding of protections. He has middle-round value but could become a third-down option early in his career.

Woody Marks,"Marks balances patience with decisiveness, setting blocks into defenders and then bursting past the collision. He glides through lanes with good vision and enough shake to create missed tackles over the first two levels. He lacks breakaway speed in the open field and contact power between the tackles. He’s highly experienced and has sure hands as a pass catcher, with the ability to elude the first tackler in space. Marks projects as a slashing complementary back capable of finding yardage and adding value on passing downs.

Jarquez Hunter,"Run-after-contact machine who can extend the play well beyond what you might expect. Hunter is a compact back renowned for his lower-body power and battering-ram mentality. He frequently tears through arm tackles and drags tacklers for extra yardage. He could use less “fight” and more “flight” when there are still moves to make on the second level. While the burst is average, he’s decisive and sees run-lane development as a zone-scheme runner. Hunter is a little limited, but his role is easily definable as a two-down pile-mover for teams looking to impose their will on the ground.

Jaydon Blue,"Blue played behind very good backs, so his carry count is lower, but he clearly has talent. He’s a narrow-hipped, linear runner with good speed to threaten wide and attack downfield out of the backfield. He has adequate wiggle in the open field but lacks base strength to break tackles. Blue’s lack of tempo and vision inside gets him behind schedule and could limit how teams use him as a ball-carrier. While he can be labeled a “change-of-pace slasher,” his real value will revolve around his ability to mismatch linebackers and threaten defenses as a receiver out of the backfield. 
Quick, agile feet to slither around the interior.
Ankle flexion allows him to make sharp turns.
Good top-end speed to widen the field on outside runs.

LeQuint Allen,"Allen is a versatile back with adequate size and speed. He’s decisive and gets what he can on most carries but lacks burst, imagination and contact force to create on his own. He’s a reliable pass-catching option with natural hands and an ability to run routes and find yards after the catch. His pass-protection willingness and execution stands out against others in this class. Allen’s ability to cover kicks and return punts adds to his value as a potential Day 3 pick who could compete for a role as a third-down option.

Damien Martinez,"Productive three-year starter with an impressive blend of power, dexterity and decisiveness. First and foremost, Martinez is truly a “big back” who proves he can find yards after contact on most carries. He lacks speed to win outside but does a nice job creating alternate routes using vision and agility when it’s congested inside. Despite a lack of breakaway speed, Martinez averaged 6.2 yards per carry on 514 career totes. He can catch passes here and there but could be best dialed in as a complementary banger capable of taking on the lion’s share of the carries if needed.

Brashard Smith,"Undersized running back who transferred from Miami and switched positions from wide receiver. Smith lacks ideal size and displays some hesitation in his early reads but is slippery over the first two levels, using quick cuts and spin moves to elude tacklers. He has a feel for finding soft spots along the interior but has average speed to turn the corner on wide runs. He could get pushed up a full round thanks to his ball skills and ability to run routes in space. Smith shined as a kick returner at Miami and will likely get that chance in the pros as a third-down back with room for development. 
Fresh legs with only 253 career carries.
Very good stop-and-start quickness when probing.
Above-average ability to get to the smoothest path on interior runs.
Processes second level quickly to spin around or side step defenders.
Former wideout with outstanding hands and ball skills.
Able to line up and run a variety of routes from the slot.
Showed off kick-return and punt-cover talent during his career at Miami.
 
Below-average size to take on a heavier workload.
Runs with a little too much hesitation in his approach.
Has a tough time outrunning pursuit to the corner.
Requires better understanding to read and set up block development.
Below-average leg drive to break through arm tackles.
Doesn’t offer up enough effort in pass protection.

Ollie Gordon II,"Big-workload back with a skill set that requires a physical, downhill run scheme. Gordon is tight-hipped and forced to run linear tracks. He plays with adequate decisiveness and interior vision but lacks the agility to cut sharply or slip tackles in tight quarters. When he gets going downhill he becomes a battering ram, slamming through tackles and adding tough yards after contact. He’s good in the screen game and could improve his protection in time. His 2024 production fell off through no fault of his own. Gordon is big and physical and could attract Day 2 attention from teams looking to add a bruiser to a two-back system. 
Big back with frame and demeanor for volume carries.
Gets going downhill without much dancing.
Adequate burst with plus tackle-breaking ability between the tackles.
Uses stiff-arm and shoulders to batter tacklers in space. 
Possesses an insatiable thirst to score when he smells paint.
Smooth screen release with natural hands.
Capable of handling protection asks with more work.
 
Production fell off in 2024.
Linear runner with tightness in his lowers.
Lacks agility for short-area elusiveness.
Below-average speed to widen the field or hit home runs.
Struggles to plant-and-go quickly on stretch plays.
Runs too high and absorbs thunderous shots.

Devin Neal,"Workload runner with NFL size and four years of steady production to help elevate the program. Neal runs with a nice blend of patience and decisiveness to choose the right lanes and maximize each carry. He lacks top-end burst and speed, which will shrink the field for him, but he’s a fall-forward runner with good contact balance and a nose for short-yardage conversions. He has good instincts and soft hands in space and can help as a leak-out or swing-pass option. His blue-collar approach isn’t exciting but it is effective and Neal has the ability to develop into a backup three-down back. 
Runs behind his blocks while maintaining decisiveness.
Keeps the run on track and won’t deviate unnecessarily.
Plays with synced-up eyes and feet for sudden transitions.
Prioritizes ball security and has a low fumble rate.
Pushes through initial contact and falls forward for yardage.
Converts short-yardage carries with downhill mentality and forward lean.
Capable receiver out of the backfield with smooth hands.
 
Average early burst to keep defenses from crowding his runs.
Takes time to gather feet and cut on a hard flow wide.
Lacks creativity to find alternate pathways when needed.
Average “make-you-miss” after the catch in space.
Needs better strain and finish to keep his quarterback protected.

DJ Giddens,"A productive runner with good size, Giddens lacks explosive elements in his game. He defies expectations as a big back who doesn’t run with heavy power. He’s a long-strider with wiggle between the tackles. He’s patient behind his blocks and quickly processes run-lane development. He’s not sudden and lacks the burst to outflank defenses, so running behind his pads and picking up the tough yardage inside might have to be his ticket into a rotation. 
Workhorse with good size and strong production.
Runs with patience, allowing bigs to get to their blocks.
Vision to see and cut into developing run lanes.
More elusive than he should be in tight quarters.
Only one fumble over his last two seasons (428 carries), per PFF.
 
Runs with long strides, making it tougher to find quick cuts.
Lacks lateral quicks and long speed to create chunk runs.
Inconsistent knee bend and power as a run finisher.
Struggles to bring in off-frame throws.
Will get the quarterback hit too often in protection.
