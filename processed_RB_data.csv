Melvin Gordon,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/melvin-gordon/3200474f-5227-5321-5a9f-5d54a292e030,"Angular, talented open-field runner who combines outstanding burst with a long stride to gain separation and hit the home run. He won't be able to outrun NFL defenders like he did in college and must develop more feel between the tackles. Gordon shines when his track runs over tackle or around the end and can put a defense to sleep around the corner. Not trustworthy enough to be a three-down back, but his pass-catching improved enough to utilize him out of backfield as a receiver.","Tall, leggy running back with shredded physique. Transitions run from inside to outside without losing any speed. Can cover five yards in two strides when fully unlocked in open field. Impressive 20-yard burst, creating space to hit the big runs. Averaged 7.6 yards per carry over last two seasons. Had 40 runs for 15-plus yards in 2014. Shifty in open field without having to hesitate. Uses jump-cut at line of scrimmage to change gaps and avoid tacklers. Has an effective spin move to make defenders miss in open field. Great agility and plus balance hurdling opponents diving at his legs. Feet keep moving in tight spaces, probing for daylight. Able to consistently beat college defenders to flank. Loves to run over the tackles. Shows ability to create for himself and has burst and agility to turn small gain into big one. Improved as a pass-catcher over second half of the 2014 season.","Desires to bounce runs wide too often. Not as trusting of blocking from B-gap to B-gap. Held to ""stuffs"" -- runs resulting in no yards or a loss -- on 19.2 percent of his carries. Feel and instincts as interior runner need improvement. Shows indecisiveness as one-cut runner. Would gear down and stutter-step to line, waiting for crease to show itself rather than adjusting on fly and taking what was available. Play strength through hole was only average. Used speed over strength to create many missed or broken tackles. Benefited from gaping running lanes. Ball security was an issue. Fumbled six times over his final five games, often being stripped while finishing run. Uncomfortable pass-catcher with marginal hands. Either dropped, double caught or smothered many throws.

Former soccer player with sudden feet. Able to string together multiple moves at a time. Varies speeds as a runner and can call on second gear when he sees daylight. Hips and feet always in sync thanks to soccer background. Shows enough wiggle to make defenders miss and can create and improvise if creases aren't offering much. Runs with wide base and generates leg drive to push. Plays with bend and bursts through the hole with low pad level. Reliable yards-after-contact back. Accelerates into contact on second level. True weapon out of backfield with adequate hands and good feel for maximizing each catch in space. Twists and turns and fights to fall forward. Asked to be physical, downhill runner between tackles and he obliged. Shows good blitz recognition. Showed mental toughness and character, coming back from deep in the doghouse for October 2011 arrest.",Gets too cute at times looking to sift laterally from gap to gap as he approaches line of scrimmage. Needs to run with more urgency to perimeter. Can get out-flanked when opportunity to turn corner was previously available. Average feel through the hole.

Was arrested for stealing sweatpants in 2011 and faced long road of severe punishment from then-coach Chris Petersen.,BOISE STATE,141,RB,Miami Dolphins,2015,"While the comparison to Marshawn Lynch might be a little much considering Lynch's exploits in the NFL, Ajayi's running style and body type are very similar to Lynch's and Ajayi features an improving stiff arm and physicality that has become Lynch's calling card. Ajayi has the ability to play all three downs while mashing in short yardage and near the goal line. Scouts have been quietly circling Ajayi as a second-tier running back who offers tremendous value on the second day (Rounds 2-3) of the draft. Good size and great feet. Former soccer player with sudden feet. Able to string together multiple moves at a time. Varies speeds as a runner and can call on second gear when he sees daylight. Hips and feet always in sync thanks to soccer background. Shows enough wiggle to make defenders miss and can create and improvise if creases aren't offering much. Runs with wide base and generates leg drive to push. Plays with bend and bursts through the hole with low pad level. Reliable yards-after-contact back. Accelerates into contact on second level. True weapon out of backfield with adequate hands and good feel for maximizing each catch in space. Twists and turns and fights to fall forward. Asked to be physical, downhill runner between tackles and he obliged. Shows good blitz recognition. Showed mental toughness and character, coming back from deep in the doghouse for October 2011 arrest. Gets too cute at times looking to sift laterally from gap to gap as he approaches line of scrimmage. Needs to run with more urgency to perimeter. Can get out-flanked when opportunity to turn corner was previously available. Average feel through the hole. Runs into defenders he should be able to avoid.

Reliable pass catcher who can hurt teams out of the backfield. Very average thickness through lower half. Struggled with a knee injury in 2013 and missed two games in 2015 with an ankle injury. Physical running style could lead to durability concerns. Not as likely to slip out of side doors against substantially better competition. Average long speed makes him more slasher than home-run hitter. Competitive resolve leads him to try and do too much on some snaps. Base narrows in space and can be susceptible to shoestring tackles. Aggression and competitiveness as a runner isn’t as readily available in pass protection. Needs to improve ball security. Has fumbled 13 times over last three seasons.","highlydetermined determinedwith withstrong strongdesire desireto tocompete competethrough throughthe thewhistle whistleon onevery everysnap highly determined strong desire compete whistle every snap. dixonpossesses possessesoutstanding outstandingfeet feetwith withexciting excitingsuddenness suddennessin inhis hischange changeof ofdirection direction, ,he he’ ’s svery verywilling willingto tofinish finishhis hisruns runswith withauthority authorityand andhas hasknack knackfor forfinding findingthe theendzone dixon possesses outstanding feet exciting suddenness change direction willing finish runs authority knack finding endzone. dixonhas hasall allthe thetraits traitsof ofbeing beingquality quality, ,three­-down three­-downstarter starterin inthe thenfl nflhis hisframe frameand andsuspect suspectpass passprotection protectionbe belong-term long-termconcerns dixon traits quality starter nfl frame suspect pass protection concerns. hungrywho whoalmost almostnever nevergives givesin into tothe thedefender hungry almost never gives defender. lighton onhis hisfeet feetusing usingoutstanding outstandingjump jump­cut ­cutand andlateral lateralquickness quicknessto tosidestep sidestepdanger dangerin inthe thebackfield backfieldand andcreate createpositive positiveplay light feet using outstanding jump lateral quickness sidestep danger backfield create positive play. elusivenesson onsecond secondlevel leveloften oftenleaves leavestacklers tacklersgrasping graspingat atair elusiveness second level often leaves tacklers grasping air. ableto tostring stringmoves movestogether togetherand andhit hitthe theexplosive explosiveplay able string moves together hit explosive play. despitebeing beingkeyed keyedon on, ,still stillcreates createsyardage yardagefor forhimself despite keyed still creates yardage. determinedand andcompetitive determined competitive. acceleratesthrough throughinitial initialcontact contactand andsqueezes squeezescarries carriesfor foreverything everythinghe hecan accelerates initial contact squeezes carries everything. averagedalmost almosttwice twiceas asmany manyyards yardsper percarry carryafter afterfirst firstcontact contact( (3 averaged almost twice many yards per carry first contact 3. 3) )than thanbefore beforefirst firstcontact contact( (1 3 first contact 1. 7) 7. greedyeater eaterwhen whenendzone endzonein inhis hissights sightswith with39 39rushing rushingtouchdowns touchdownssince since2014 greedy eater endzone sights 39 rushing touchdowns since 2014. quickrecognition recognitionof ofdefensive defensiveflow flowand andadjusts adjustslanes lanesaccordingly quick recognition defensive flow adjusts lanes accordingly. decisivewith withplus plusburst burstand andability abilityto tocharge chargeit itup upto tohis histop topspeed speedinstantly decisive plus burst ability charge top speed instantly. hasvery verygood goodfeel feelfor forlanes lanesand andtacklers tacklersand andis isable ableto tonavigate navigateboth bothwithout withoutmuch muchwasted wastedmovement good feel lanes tacklers able navigate without much wasted movement. violentfinisher finisherfor forhis hissize sizeand andenjoys enjoysthumping thumpingcorners cornersand andsafeties violent finisher size enjoys thumping corners safeties. reliablepass passcatcher catcherwho whocan canhurt hurtteams teamsout outof ofthe thebackfield reliable pass catcher hurt teams backfield. veryaverage averagethickness thicknessthrough throughlower lowerhalf average thickness lower half. struggledwith withknee kneeinjury injuryin in2013 2013and andmissed missedtwo twogames gamesin in2015 2015with withan anankle ankleinjury struggled knee injury 2013 missed two games 2015 ankle injury. physicalstyle stylelead leadto todurability durabilityconcerns physical style lead durability concerns. notas aslikely likelyto toslip slipout outof ofside sidedoors doorsagainst againstsubstantially substantiallybetter bettercompetition likely slip side doors substantially better competition. averagelong longspeed speedmakes makeshim himmore moreslasher slasherthan thanhome-run home-runhitter average long speed makes slasher hitter. competitiveresolve resolveleads leadshim himto totry tryand anddo dotoo toomuch muchon onsome somesnaps competitive resolve leads try much snaps. basenarrows narrowsin inspace spaceand andcan canbe besusceptible susceptibleto toshoestring shoestringtackles base narrows space susceptible shoestring tackles. aggressionand andcompetitiveness competitivenessas asisn isn’ ’t tas asreadily readilyavailable availablein inpass passprotection aggression competitiveness readily available pass protection. needsto toimprove improveball ballsecurity needs improve ball security. hasfumbled fumbled13 13times timesover overlast lastthree threeseasons fumbled 13 times last three seasons.

Joe Mixon,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joe-mixon/32004d49-5856-4388-c611-05b6fcff1d1d,"I've decided to give Joe Mixon a draft grade based on his talent and expected output if given a chance as an NFL running back. His draft slot will likely be impacted by his domestic violence issue. Mixon has the talent to be an every-down, all-day running back with the potential to take over a game on the ground or through the air. Life against weaker Big 12 defenses has created a more relaxed rushing approach for Mixon who will have to play at a faster pace as an NFL back. Mixon's vision is just average and he could struggle to create for himself in front of a subpar offensive line; however, he can play in any rushing scheme and can be moved all over the field as a matchup option.",Outstanding burst to go from first level to third level. Goes from glide to burst quickly and can hit chunk plays between tackles and around corners. Can go from elusive to banger when he needs to. Will drop the pads and drive through tacklers in short yardage spots. Flashy feet for his size. Can jump-cut around defenders in tight quarters. Smooth hips help him swivel around the second and third levels. Able to show and go leaving linebackers diving as he escapes out of the side door. Strong stiff-arm helps would-be tacklers catch grass stains. Can turn the corner and create a straightaway to the end zone. Was Big 12 leader in percentage of explosive carries (15-plus yards) at 11.9 percent. True three-down back. Devastating pass catching option. Excellent route runner creating immediate separation. Soft hands to make the easy catch and the one-hander. Will step in and square up his blocking responsibilities in pass game. ,Some in scouting community concerned with character beyond his domestic violence incident. Inconsistent as inside runner. Can be too patient at times. Looks for wide-open points of entry before he hits the gas. Can be nonchalant approaching line of scrimmage. Dances downhill allowing running lanes to become creases. Feet lag behind when headed into congestion and will get loose with his rush track inviting tacklers a chance to get a hand on him. Lacks creativity in initial stages of his run at times. Vision is just average. Fails to see backside cuts developing on stretch plays.

Mack has plenty of wiggle to bounce from run lane to run lane and make tacklers miss, but he has a penchant for looking to break runs way outside when the interior becomes too trafficked and he won't be able to get away with that against NFL speed. Mack is a complementary runner who can hit big runs against defenses who have been worn down, but he needs to be matched with the right scheme in order to unlock his big-play potential.",Looks like he has ball bearings in his hips. Able to swivel in multiple directions. Can tilt and slalom around defenders on the second and third level and is able to string moves together.

Drops shoulder to punish final tackler. Uses wicked stiff-arm to punch and swat tacklers to the ground. Creates for himself through brute force. Natural power in lower half. Doesn't need a clean point of entry for aggressive, downhill charge. Excellent contact balance despite heavy shots on his legs. Short-yardage specialist who can move the chains and score touchdowns. Willing to leave his feet and sacrifice body near goal line. Willing blocker in pass pro and showed ability to come out of backfield in wheel routes, swing passes and outs.  Needs a clean slate of blocks to consistently make his way around the corner on the next level. Could struggle to accelerate from tacklers if he gets too cute. Runs with stiff hips and heavy legs. Lacks quick-escape athleticism for sudden shake in open field. All power, no finesse. Early defensive penetration short-circuits his run. Average lateral movement and not desired amount for every-down back. Can be a little slow to process moving parts in front of him. Not a press-and-cut back and needs to learn to set blocks up better. Hands a little stiff as pass catcher and will fight the ball at times. Tape shows occasional confusion in blitz pick-up. Medical concerns will continue to follow him.","physical, ,battering-ram battering-ramstyle stylewho whomakes makesthe thehitting hittingtwo-way two-wayaffair physical style makes hitting affair. conner's 'slack lackof ofspeed speedand andreactive reactivequickness quicknesslimit limithis hisrole roleas aspro pro, ,his hisheart heart, ,work workethic ethicand andability abilityto tokeep keepthe thechains chainsmoving movingmake makehim himred-zone red-zonespecialist specialistwith withthe theability abilityto tohandle handlesome somethird thirddown downduties dutiesas aswell conner lack speed reactive quickness limit role pro heart work ethic ability keep chains moving make specialist ability handle third duties well. teamcaptain captainknown knownfor forincredible incredibleresilience resilienceand andmental mentaltoughness team captain known incredible resilience mental toughness. leaneddown downand andadded addedmore moremuscle musclemass massthis thisseason leaned added muscle mass season. armtackles tacklesare arewaste wasteof oftime arm tackles waste time. carriesheavy heavymomentum momentumbehind behindpads padsat atfinish carries heavy momentum behind pads finish. dropsshoulder shoulderto topunish punishfinal finaltackler drops shoulder punish final tackler. useswicked wickedstiff-arm stiff-armto topunch punchand andswat swattacklers tacklersto tothe theground uses wicked punch swat tacklers ground. createsfor forhimself himselfthrough throughbrute bruteforce creates brute force. naturalpower powerin inlower lowerhalf natural power lower half. doesn't n'tneed needclean cleanpoint pointof ofentry entryfor foraggressive aggressive, ,downhill downhillcharge need clean point entry aggressive downhill charge. excellentcontact contactbalance balancedespite despiteheavy heavyshots shotson onhis hislegs excellent contact balance despite heavy shots legs. short-yardagespecialist specialistwho whocan canmove movethe thechains chainsand andscore scoretouchdowns specialist move chains score touchdowns. willingto toleave leavehis hisfeet feetand andsacrifice sacrificebody bodynear neargoal goalline willing leave feet sacrifice body near goal line. willingblocker blockerin inpass passpro proand andshowed showedability abilityto tocome comeout outof ofbackfield backfieldin inwheel wheelroutes routes, ,swing swingpasses passesand andouts willing blocker pass pro showed ability come backfield wheel routes swing passes outs. needsclean cleanslate slateof ofblocks blocksto toconsistently consistentlymake makehis hisway wayaround aroundthe thecorner corneron onthe thenext nextlevel needs clean slate blocks consistently make way around corner next level. struggleto toaccelerate acceleratefrom fromtacklers tacklersif ifhe hegets getstoo toocute struggle accelerate tacklers gets cute. runswith withstiff stiffhips hipsand andheavy heavylegs runs stiff hips heavy legs. lacksquick-escape quick-escapeathleticism athleticismfor forsudden suddenshake shakein inopen openfield lacks athleticism sudden shake open field. allpower power, ,no nofinesse power finesse. earlydefensive defensivepenetration penetrationshort-circuits short-circuitshis hisrun early defensive penetration run. averagelateral lateralmovement movementand andnot notdesired desiredamount amountfor forevery-down average lateral movement desired amount. canbe belittle littleslow slowto toprocess processmoving movingparts partsin infront frontof ofhim little slow process moving parts front. notpress-and-cut press-and-cutand andneeds needsto tolearn learnto toset setblocks blocksup upbetter needs learn set blocks better. handslittle littlestiff stiffas aspass passcatcher catcherand andwill willfight fightthe theball ballat attimes hands little stiff pass catcher fight ball times. tapeshows showsoccasional occasionalconfusion confusionin inblitz blitzpick-up tape shows occasional confusion blitz. medicalconcerns concernswill willcontinue continueto tofollow followhim medical concerns continue follow.

If Carson works out well, he could hear his name called on Day 3. Built like an NFL running back. Chiseled from granite with a broad chest and thickly muscled shoulders. Reinvented himself from finesse to power after ribbing in the running backs meeting room. Lead shoulder carries pop in it. Drops pads at impact and is able to drive through initial contact. Bow-legged gait produces wider frame with better balance. Leg tackles often slide off and are left with nothing. Will press line of scrimmage to set up subtle cutback opportunity. Able to create separation out of backfield on crossing routes. Has adequate wiggle in open field after the catch. Never fumbled in 212 carries at Oklahoma State. Runs with tight hips and low-knee action. Runs too upright. Missing the flexibility to sink and cut sharply. Long strider who will struggle to gather his feet quickly enough for sudden change of direction against early penetration. Burst through line of of scrimmage is average. Lacks explosive, playmaking potential. Never notched a rush of over 26 yards during his 212 carries at Oklahoma State. Missed time this season and last with injuries.","carsonis isan animmediate immediatewinner winnerof ofthe theeyeball eyeballtest test, ,that thathas hasn't n'talways alwaysbeen beentrue trueof ofhis hisstyle carson immediate winner eyeball test always true style. hisshift shiftfrom fromfinesse finesseto tomore morepower-based power-basedstyle stylefits fitshis hissize sizeand andphysical physicalattributes attributesand andgives giveshim himbetter bettershot shotof ofplaying playingon onsundays shift finesse style fits size physical attributes gives better shot playing sundays. carsonis issuited suitedto todownhill downhillattack attackthat thatallows allowshim himto tobe bethe thehammer hammerrather ratherthan thanthe thenail nail, ,he he's 'sunlikely unlikelyto tocreate createfor forhimself himselfwith withelusiveness elusivenessor orspeed carson suited downhill attack allows hammer rather nail unlikely create elusiveness speed. ifcarson carsonworks worksout outwell well, ,he hehear hearhis hisname namecalled calledon onday day3 carson works well hear name called day 3. builtlike likean annfl built like nfl. chiseledfrom fromgranite granitewith withbroad broadchest chestand andthickly thicklymuscled muscledshoulders chiseled granite broad chest thickly muscled shoulders. reinventedhimself himselffrom fromfinesse finesseto topower powerafter afterribbing ribbingin inthe thebacks backsmeeting meetingroom reinvented finesse power ribbing backs meeting room. leadshoulder shouldercarries carriespop popin init lead shoulder carries pop. dropspads padsat atimpact impactand andis isable ableto todrive drivethrough throughinitial initialcontact drops pads impact able drive initial contact. bow-leggedgait gaitproduces produceswider widerframe framewith withbetter betterbalance gait produces wider frame better balance. legtackles tacklesoften oftenslide slideoff offand andare areleft leftwith withnothing leg tackles often slide left nothing. willpress pressline lineof ofscrimmage scrimmageto toset setup upsubtle subtlecutback cutbackopportunity press line scrimmage set subtle cutback opportunity. ableto tocreate createseparation separationout outof ofbackfield backfieldon oncrossing crossingroutes able create separation backfield crossing routes. hasadequate adequatewiggle wigglein inopen openfield fieldafter afterthe thecatch adequate wiggle open field catch. neverfumbled fumbledin in212 212carries carriesat atoklahoma oklahomastate never fumbled 212 carries oklahoma state. runswith withtight tighthips hipsand andlow-knee low-kneeaction runs tight hips action. runstoo tooupright runs upright. missingthe theflexibility flexibilityto tosink sinkand andcut cutsharply missing flexibility sink cut sharply. longstrider striderwho whowill willstruggle struggleto togather gatherhis hisfeet feetquickly quicklyenough enoughfor forsudden suddenchange changeof ofdirection directionagainst againstearly earlypenetration long strider struggle gather feet quickly enough sudden change direction early penetration. burstthrough throughline lineof ofof ofscrimmage scrimmageis isaverage burst line scrimmage average. lacksexplosive explosive, ,playmaking playmakingpotential lacks explosive playmaking potential. nevernotched notchedrush rushof ofover over26 26yards yardsduring duringhis his212 212carries carriesat atoklahoma oklahomastate never notched rush 26 yards 212 carries oklahoma state. missedtime timethis thisseason seasonand andlast lastwith withinjuries missed time season last injuries.

Love lacks the desired size of a volume runner, but his sudden burst and top-end speed offer home-run potential that is unlikely to be ignored by teams looking to add a big-play option into their offense. Love could find his calling in a time-share situation, but his ceiling as a pro might rest on his ability to run with decisiveness and threaten as a pass-catcher.. Character considered an A+ by scouts. Highly intelligent and quick to process new information. Willing to play through pain. Keeps feet moving through his reads. Quick, controlled steps provide balance and on-demand acceleration. Wins foot races around the corner against linebackers. Burst and top-end speed to turn 16 yards into 60. Runs feet through contact as interior runner. Able to get skinny and squeeze through tight creases. Slides and pivots around big bodies littering his path. Rare ability to stay square in his lateral movements away from tacklers. Better pass-catching option than numbers would indicate. Tweener size might hinder both rush volume and draft value. Excessive stutter-and-gather in his downhill approach. Running style is more frantic than fluid. Will need to run with better trust and anticipation as a pro. Somewhat average in setting up defenders before his cuts. Field vision and recognition of backside opportunities is average. Lacks size to prolong NFL runs after contact. Could struggle to hold his ground in blitz protection.

He's not much of a third-down option, but his history as a punt-team gunner works in his favor. Impressive burst to race past second level. Able to take away downhill angles for support safeties. Plenty of juice to threaten perimeter on stretch plays. Change of pace slasher. Subtly alters his rush track to his advantage during the run. Fleet feet constantly on the move. Able to make quality open field cuts. Ball security has been good, with one fumble over the past two years. Showed ability to handle gunner duties in 2018. Nice agility for lateral cut and go. Slippery to tackle. Offers no pass protection help. Hasn't been used for any meaningful pass-catching duties. Unafraid of interior running but is not built for it. Durability could be a concern. Always hurrying and could cut with better patience. Rarely gathers and reassess his run options as an improvisational creator. Not as elusive as expected. Doesn't slow his pace and set up tacklers to miss with wiggle.","change-of-pacewith withvery verygood goodburst burstbelow belowaverage averagesize sizethat thatlimit limithis hisnfl nflsuitors good burst average size limit nfl suitors. calaisis isfairly fairlytalented talented( (and andcourageous courageous) )as asan aninside/outside inside/outsidezone zone, ,as aspro pro, ,he hewill willlikely likelybe beconsidered consideredgadget gadgetwho whomakes makeshis hisliving livingin inopen openspace calais fairly talented courageous zone pro likely considered gadget makes living open space. hisplay playspeed speedis iswhat whatgives giveshim himchance chance, ,he heneeds needsto torun runwith withbetter betterpatience patienceto toimprove improvehis hiscontrol controland andelusiveness elusivenessin inthe theopen openfield play speed gives chance needs run better patience improve control elusiveness open field. he's 'snot notmuch muchof ofthird-down third-downoption option, ,his hishistory historyas aspunt-team punt-teamgunner gunnerworks worksin inhis hisfavor much option history gunner works favor. impressiveburst burstto torace racepast pastsecond secondlevel impressive burst race past second level. ableto totake takeaway awaydownhill downhillangles anglesfor forsupport supportsafeties able take away downhill angles support safeties. plentyof ofjuice juiceto tothreaten threatenperimeter perimeteron onstretch stretchplays plenty juice threaten perimeter stretch plays. changeof ofpace paceslasher change pace slasher. subtlyalters altershis hisrush rushtrack trackto tohis hisadvantage advantageduring duringthe therun subtly alters rush track advantage run. fleetfeet feetconstantly constantlyon onthe themove fleet feet constantly move. ableto tomake makequality qualityopen openfield fieldcuts able make quality open field cuts. ballsecurity securityhas hasbeen beengood good, ,with withone onefumble fumbleover overthe thepast pasttwo twoyears ball security good one fumble past two years. showedability abilityto tohandle handlegunner gunnerduties dutiesin in2018 showed ability handle gunner duties 2018. niceagility agilityfor forlateral lateralcut cutand andgo nice agility lateral cut go. slipperyto totackle slippery tackle. offersno nopass passprotection protectionhelp offers pass protection help. hasn't n'tbeen beenused usedfor forany anymeaningful meaningfulpass-catching pass-catchingduties used meaningful duties. unafraidof ofinterior interioris isnot notbuilt builtfor forit unafraid interior built. durabilitybe beconcern durability concern. alwayshurrying hurryingand andcut cutwith withbetter betterpatience always hurrying cut better patience. rarelygathers gathersand andreassess reassesshis hisrun runoptions optionsas asan animprovisational improvisationalcreator rarely gathers reassess run options improvisational creator. notas aselusive elusiveas asexpected elusive expected. doesn't n'tslow slowhis hispace paceand andset setup uptacklers tacklersto tomiss misswith withwiggle slow pace set tacklers miss wiggle.

He runs with tempo and flow but alters his rush track at a moment's notice when needed. He is elusive but lacking the instant burst of a slasher capable of stacking long runs in a single game. Akers has above-average open-field vision once he's into the second level and looks to run through the tackler's pads as a finisher. He's a three-down option with good feel for finding the crease near the goal line, but ball security needs to improve. He can be Leg 1 or 2 of a tandem rushing attack and is one of the more natural runners in the draft. Compact, rocked-up build with powerful legs. Played behind subpar run blocking and often found his own production. Tough finisher who's able to shred arm tackles and balance through contact. Wicked open-field spin move to slip defender. Instinctive runner with good feel for run-lane development. Multiple cuts and run-lane resets without losing momentum. Eyes and feet work in unison.

He usually looks to get the edge and almost always does. He is a very effective short-area mover who can ignite a two-step power move to beat a defender laterally and get to the edge. He is the type of athlete whose explosion is obvious every time he sticks his toes in the ground. He is always a threat to get the edge, make one quick inside move, and take it the distance. He is a straight-line runner but is elusive and make defenders miss in the open field. He is a good route runner out of the backfield and out of the slot and he will likely get work there early in the pros. Rainey is undersized and it shows when he tries to run inside or pass protect. He almost always looks to get outside and will go down on contact when running in the box. He is not willing nor able to block linebackers and protect the quarterback and will get overpowered at the next level. He is a strict work-in-space player at the next level and will have a hard time playing as a traditional running back.","rainey, ,like likehis histeammate teammatejeff jeffdemps demps, ,is isburner burnerand andchallenge challengethe therecord recordfor forfastest fastest40-yard 40-yarddash dashtime timeat atthis thisyear year's 'scombine rainey like teammate jeff demps burner challenge record fastest dash time year combine. unlikedemps demps, ,his histrack-speed track-speedtranslates translatesto tothe thefootball footballfield field, ,which whichmakes makeshim himan anintriguing intriguingprospect prospectwho whohas hasplayed playedvarious variousroles roleswithin withinflorida florida's 'soffense unlike demps translates football field makes intriguing prospect played various roles within florida offense. whilenot notnearly nearlyas asbig bigas asformer formerteammate teammatepercy percyharvin harvin, ,rainey raineyhas hasbeen beenable ableto todeliver deliverfor forthe thegators gatorsin insimilar similarfashion nearly big former teammate percy harvin rainey able deliver gators similar fashion. heuses useshis hissupreme supremeagility agilityand andfoot footquickness quicknessto tomake makeguys guysmiss missand andmake makean anelectric electricplay playwhenever wheneverhe hetouches touchesthe theball uses supreme agility foot quickness make guys miss make electric play whenever touches ball. hemove moveup upinto intothe themiddle middlerounds roundsby byapril aprilif ifhe hecontinues continuesto todisplay displayhis hisathletic athleticability abilityin inthe thecoming comingmonths move middle rounds april continues display athletic ability coming months. raineyis isquick quickoff offthe thesnap snapto tomake makedecision decisionand andhit hitthe thehole holehard rainey quick snap make decision hit hole hard. heusually usuallylooks looksto toget getthe theedge edgeand andalmost almostalways alwaysdoes usually looks get edge almost always. heis isvery veryeffective effectiveshort-area short-areamover moverwho whocan canignite ignitetwo-step two-steppower powermove moveto tobeat beatdefender defenderlaterally laterallyand andget getto tothe theedge effective mover ignite power move beat defender laterally get edge. heis isthe thetype typeof ofathlete athletewhose whoseexplosion explosionis isobvious obviousevery everytime timehe hesticks stickshis histoes toesin inthe theground type athlete whose explosion obvious every time sticks toes ground. heis isalways alwaysthreat threatto toget getthe theedge edge, ,make makeone onequick quickinside insidemove move, ,and andtake takeit itthe thedistance always threat get edge make one quick inside move take distance. heis isstraight-line straight-lineis iselusive elusiveand andmake makedefenders defendersmiss missin inthe theopen openfield elusive make defenders miss open field. heis isgood goodroute routeout outof ofthe thebackfield backfieldand andout outof ofthe theslot slotand andhe hewill willlikely likelyget getwork workthere thereearly earlyin inthe thepros good route backfield slot likely get work early pros. raineyis isundersized undersizedand andit itshows showswhen whenhe hetries triesto torun runinside insideor orpass passprotect rainey undersized shows tries run inside pass protect. healmost almostalways alwayslooks looksto toget getoutside outsideand andwill willgo godown downon oncontact contactwhen whenin inthe thebox almost always looks get outside go contact box. heis isnot notwilling willingnor norable ableto toblock blocklinebackers linebackersand andprotect protectthe thequarterback quarterbackand andwill willget getoverpowered overpoweredat atthe thenext nextlevel willing able block linebackers protect quarterback get overpowered next level. heis isstrict strictwork-in-space work-in-spaceplayer playerat atthe thenext nextlevel leveland andwill willhave havehard hardtime timeplaying playingas astraditional strict player next level hard time playing traditional.

He is very reliable as a pass catcher and ran a lot of polished routes out of the backfield for RG3.

","Possesses above-average straight-line speed. Attacks the line of scrimmage in one-back formations. Good vision and foot quickness for the cutback, has a burst through the hole and can accelerate away from oncoming defenders. Tough for college safeties to get an angle on.

Runs with some lean for his size, and he lowers his pads pre-contact to get an extra yard. Takes big hits and bounces back up. Tight-ropes the sideline when necessary to maximize runs. Shows the ability to create behind the line of scrimmage when the play side breaks down, and the creativity and knowledge of pursuit angles to set up second level defenders. Shows patience running behind pulling guards and fullbacks, can cut in either direction off the block. Stiff-arm in the open field can be effective in keeping away defensive backs. Very dangerous in space. Good hands to be a threat as a receiver in the flat, over the middle, on screens, and down the sideline on wheel routes.
