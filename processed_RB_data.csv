Melvin Gordon,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/melvin-gordon/3200474f-5227-5321-5a9f-5d54a292e030,"Angular, talented open-field runner who combines outstanding burst with a long stride to gain separation and hit the home run. He won't be able to outrun NFL defenders like he did in college and must develop more feel between the tackles. Gordon shines when his track runs over tackle or around the end and can put a defense to sleep around the corner. Not trustworthy enough to be a three-down back, but his pass-catching improved enough to utilize him out of backfield as a receiver.","Tall, leggy running back with shredded physique. Transitions run from inside to outside without losing any speed. Can cover five yards in two strides when fully unlocked in open field. Impressive 20-yard burst, creating space to hit the big runs. Averaged 7.6 yards per carry over last two seasons. Had 40 runs for 15-plus yards in 2014. Shifty in open field without having to hesitate. Uses jump-cut at line of scrimmage to change gaps and avoid tacklers. Has an effective spin move to make defenders miss in open field. Great agility and plus balance hurdling opponents diving at his legs. Feet keep moving in tight spaces, probing for daylight. Able to consistently beat college defenders to flank. Loves to run over the tackles. Shows ability to create for himself and has burst and agility to turn small gain into big one. Improved as a pass-catcher over second half of the 2014 season.","Desires to bounce runs wide too often. Not as trusting of blocking from B-gap to B-gap. Held to ""stuffs"" -- runs resulting in no yards or a loss -- on 19.2 percent of his carries. Feel and instincts as interior runner need improvement. Shows indecisiveness as one-cut runner. Would gear down and stutter-step to line, waiting for crease to show itself rather than adjusting on fly and taking what was available. Play strength through hole was only average. Used speed over strength to create many missed or broken tackles. Benefited from gaping running lanes. Ball security was an issue. Fumbled six times over his final five games, often being stripped while finishing run. Uncomfortable pass-catcher with marginal hands. Either dropped, double caught or smothered many throws.

Abdullah has explosive potential as a runner and ball-catcher and is a natural zone-scheme fit. His high character will make him a hit during interview process.",Decisive runner with good lower-body drive and a willingness to run behind his pads. Finishes his runs. Has NFL-caliber burst and can hit top speed quickly. Defenses must respect his ability to turn the corner on play-side. Patient runner with plus vision. Willing to seek out cutback lanes. Rarely dances to the line or makes unnecessary lateral moves. Isn't a predictable runner. Lacks blazing top-end speed but plays fast. Highly competitive with a high football IQ.

Karlos Williams,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/karlos-williams/32005749-4c39-8250-3203-7c4584bc633d,"Williams is a big, talented athlete who is still finding his way as a running back. He seemed almost content to lose his job in 2014 and teams will be turning over every rock looking for information on his character. As a one-cut runner with exceptional burst and rare physical traits, Williams could become a very good starter in a zone-based scheme, but his floor is very low based on character and scheme fit.","Former safety with aggressive, physical temperament. Taller and longer than most running backs, but has exceptional burst to trim the corner and go. Angular running style. Makes subtle changes of direction without gearing down. One-cut daddy on outside zone plays. Has good top-end speed. Can be a factor on swing passes and will body up in pass protection. Lowers pads and delivers a blow on the move. Falls forward and is a pile mover when pad level is right. Natural footwork for an inexperienced back. Slams it between tackles when asked and doesn't look to bounce outside. Shows patience and uses head fakes to freeze defenders in space. Hard to tackle and keeps feet churning at impact.","Upright runner. Has issues playing with leverage when challenged suddenly in the hole. Needs to see contact coming to get pads low enough. Has just two years of running back experience. Instincts and feel are very hit and miss. Runs himself into trouble and might not fit all running schemes. Doesn't make many defenders miss on second level.

Was investigated by Tallahassee police in domestic battery case, but no charges were filed. Character will be combed over carefully.",FLORIDA STATE,147,RB,Buffalo Bills,2015,"Williams is a big, talented athlete who is still finding his way as a running back. He seemed almost content to lose his job in 2014 and teams will be turning over every rock looking for information on his character. As a one-cut runner with exceptional burst and rare physical traits, Williams could become a very good starter in a zone-based scheme, but his floor is very low based on character and scheme fit. Former safety with aggressive, physical temperament. Taller and longer than most running backs, but has exceptional burst to trim the corner and go. Angular running style. Makes subtle changes of direction without gearing down. One-cut daddy on outside zone plays. Has good top-end speed. Can be a factor on swing passes and will body up in pass protection. Lowers pads and delivers a blow on the move. Falls forward and is a pile mover when pad level is right. Natural footwork for an inexperienced back. Slams it between tackles when asked and doesn't look to bounce outside. Shows patience and uses head fakes to freeze defenders in space. Hard to tackle and keeps feet churning at impact. Upright runner. Has issues playing with leverage when challenged suddenly in the hole. Needs to see contact coming to get pads low enough. Has just two years of running back experience. Instincts and feel are very hit and miss. Runs himself into trouble and might not fit all running schemes. Doesn't make many defenders miss on second level.

Henry's long legs and angular running style is a much better fit for downhill running teams who value lead backs and physicality. Henry needs early running room as he's not a creator in the backfield, but once he gets up a full head of steam, he is a nightmare with his ability to punish on the second and third level or take it to the house. Henry should come in and provide immediate production as a starter.","One of the biggest running backs you will ever see. Can be a violent runner without even trying. Pummels tacklers with forward lean and dynamite behind his pads. Gives run-­support cornerbacks bad dreams. Rare top­-end speed for a runner his size. Long strides from second to third level cut into reaction time for safeties and often leave them a step short and grasping for air. Effective in zone, gap and power schemes. Rarely fatigues and wears down defenses as game goes on. Had 29.6 percent of his explosive carries come in the fourth quarter. Makes consistent, initial reads as a zone runner. Against 
Mississippi State, took outside zone run and cut it all the way back across formation out­racing defense for 65-yard touchdown. Led nation in missed tackles forced with 60. Uses subtle change of direction on the second level  while keeping runs north/south. Used as a possession bully in short yardage spots and when Alabama wanted to impose their will.","With almost 400 touches this year, scouts are concerned about his workload. Averaged almost 32 carries against SEC competition including 90 carries over his final two regular season games. Tall, long-strider who takes time to build up his speed. Average foot quickness can lead to tackles for losses if he gets too cute in the backfield. Needs to improve his second read as a zone runner. Ineffective in passing game with below average hands.

Pad level and knee bend are outstanding. Keeps shoulders square to the line and stays low and tight through the hole.

Dixon possesses outstanding feet with exciting suddenness in his change of direction, but he’s very willing to finish his runs with authority and has a knack for finding the endzone. Dixon has all the traits of being a quality, three­-down starter in the NFL but his frame and suspect pass protection could be long-term concerns.","Hungry runner who almost never gives in to the defender. Light on his feet using outstanding jump ­cut and lateral quickness to sidestep danger in the backfield and create a positive play. Elusiveness on second level often leaves tacklers grasping at air. Able to string moves together and hit the explosive play. Despite being keyed on, still creates yardage for himself. Determined and competitive. Accelerates through initial contact and squeezes carries for everything he can. Averaged almost twice as many yards per carry after first contact (3.3) than before first contact (1.7). Greedy eater when endzone in his sights with 39 rushing touchdowns since 2014. Quick recognition of defensive flow and adjusts running lanes accordingly. Decisive runner with plus burst and ability to charge it up to his top speed instantly. Has very

Physical running style could lead to durability concerns. Not as likely to slip out of side doors against substantially better competition. Average long speed makes him more slasher than home-run hitter. Competitive resolve leads him to try and do too much on some snaps. Base narrows in space and can be susceptible to shoestring tackles.

Jonathan Williams,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jonathan-williams/32005749-4c38-4555-6a9c-d6163c44fa20,"Has enough size, heart and talent to be a three-down running back, but was a proven commodity as a fresh runner in a committee approach at Arkansas. Williams is one of the more creative runners in tight quarters that you will find in this draft, but teams won't have to sacrifice too much toughness in order to take advantage of his slashing style. Williams' physicals at the combine will be huge since teams are justifiably concerned when the long term health of running backs who sustain foot injuries.","Loose hips and quick feet are his calling card. Crafty with outstanding lateral movement to side­step tacklers in the backfield, in the hole and on the second level. Light feet allow for immediate actions and reactions when needed. Forced 44 missed tackles in 2014. Has excellent instincts. Great feel through the hole maintaining distance from tacklers and finds the best running lane possible most of the time. Limited tread ­wear with just 406 carries at Arkansas. Sets up his blocks well and runs with good balance through contact and an ability to run through arm tackles. Played in physical running game and will finish runs stronger than most slashing backs. Dependable in short yardage with the fortitude for short yardage situations. Three-down running back with soft hands out of the backfield. Willing to do his part in pass protection.","Needs to play with consistent burst and decisiveness. Spoiled between massive Arkansas offensive line that blew open gaping lanes that he won't see in the pros. Against Georgia (2014), made bad decisions to break inside runs outside because lanes were tighter than usual. At times, got too cute in the hole rather than planting and bursting upfield. Thin calves. Could use a little more thickness in his legs. Missed entire 2014 season after surgery to repair a left foot injury in August. Must get better at protecting football at point of impact.

Hesitant runner through creases like back expecting to be tackled rather than running to daylight. Weight gets too far out over toes causing lack of balance.

Dalvin Cook,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dalvin-cook/3200434f-4f04-7079-ca3d-32c8b4ce8a9a,"Very talented runner with outstanding balance, footwork and burst. Cook lacks the power that you may find with some running backs in this year's draft, but he is a homerun hitter with a resume featuring monster games against his most highly regarded opponents. Cook creates for himself with elusiveness and speed, but his value could be diminished by injuries, character and issues in pass protection. If everything checks out, he could become a rookie of the year candidate right away.","Uses choppy feet and compact stride length downhill. Keeps feet under him and is able to make lateral cuts at a moment's notice. Flourished in zone, gap and power schemes at FSU. At his best running wide while setting up lead blockers. Slows flowing safeties and linebackers with hesitation steps and glances back inside. Has run-away gear around the corner he keeps tucked away for special occasions. Darting style allows him to escape defenders who show gap commitment too soon. Plus vision. Quick to flow from first to second read on outside zone plays. Greedy redzone runner with ability to cash those checks. The brighter the lights, the bigger his game. Comfortable in both one-back and two-back groupings. Rare ability to cut it all the way back across the grain. Changes direction with degree of subtlety on second level without gearing down. Not much of a dancer. Tends to get hit it up the field. Feet in constant state of motion. Despite drops, can be dangerous out of backfield.
Explosive ; Elusive; has moves in the open field to dodge blockers ; Tremendous open-field runner ; Fast; can break off long runs on any carry ; Threat to score on any carry ; Rare acceleration ; Has enough strength to get yards after contact ; Excellent vision ; Great feet ; Cutting ability ; Good build and size ; Finishes runs well ; Burst to the hole ; Has great straight-line speed to pull away from defenders ; Shiftiness; will juke defenders ; Rare receiving ability ; Superb route-runner ; Excellent hands ; Receiving ability ; Willing blocker in blitz pickup – has potential to be very good ; Has a nose for the end zone ; Wears down defenses ; Excellent knee bend ; Runs behind his pads ; Runs well in the second half ; Good fit for a zone-blocking system ; Perfect fit for a man-blocking system ; Plays injured ; Solid character","Not always a tough inside runner. Can be early to bounce it outside rather than plant and go downhill. Needs to become more comfortable between the tackles. Excellent vision to the perimeter becomes cloudier between the b-gaps. Will duck head and finish a run prematurely rather than probing for more interior space. Not always small through the crease. Flashes ability to finish with authority but makes business decisions at times. Hips not as fluid as expected. Would benefit from use of a hearty stiff-arm. Inconsistent hands in all phases. Ball security issues with 13 career fumbles. Suffers from focus drops out of backfield. Won't square-up on blitzers and may not be reliable enough as blocker to play on third downs. 
Ball security ; Must cut down on fumbles ; His power and yards after contact will probably be diminished in the NFL ; Teams worry about off-the-field trouble stemming his friends and entourage ;Summary:  Cook was an impactful player for the Seminoles from his first day with the program. As a freshman, he beat out more experienced backs to be the feature runner who replaced Devonta Freeman. With Jameis Winston under center, Cook turned in an excellent true freshman season in 2014, averaging 5.9 yards per carry for 1,008 yards and eight touchdowns. He caught 22 passes for 203 yards, too.",FLORIDA STATE,41,RB,Minnesota Vikings,2017,"Very talented runner with outstanding balance, footwork and burst.

Keeps feet under him and is able to make lateral cuts at a moment's notice. Flourished in zone, gap and power schemes at FSU. At his best running wide while setting up lead blockers. Slows flowing safeties and linebackers with hesitation steps and glances back inside. Has run-away gear around the corner he keeps tucked away for special occasions. Darting style allows him to escape defenders who show gap commitment too soon. Plus vision. Quick to flow from first to second read on outside zone plays. Greedy redzone runner with ability to cash those checks. The brighter the lights, the bigger his game. Comfortable in both one-back and two-back groupings. Rare ability to cut it all the way back across the grain. Changes direction with degree of subtlety on second level without gearing down. Not much of a dancer. Tends to get hit it up the field. Feet in constant state of motion. Despite drops, can be dangerous out of backfield.
Explosive ; Elusive; has moves in the open field to dodge blockers ; Tremendous open-field runner ; Fast; can break off long runs on any carry ; Threat to score on any carry ; Rare acceleration ; Has enough strength to get yards after contact ; Excellent vision ; Great feet ; Cutting ability ; Good build and size ; Finishes runs well ; Burst to the hole ; Has great straight-line speed to pull away from defenders ; Shiftiness; will juke defenders ; Rare receiving ability ; Superb route-runner ; Excellent hands ; Receiving ability ; Willing blocker in blitz pickup – has potential to be very good ; Has a nose for the end zone ; Wears down defenses ; Excellent knee bend ; Runs behind his pads ; Runs well in the second half ; Good fit for a zone-blocking system ; Perfect fit for a man-blocking system ; Plays injured ; Solid character Not always a tough inside runner. Can be early to bounce it outside rather than plant and go downhill. Needs to become more comfortable between the tackles. Excellent vision to the perimeter becomes cloudier between the b-gaps. Will duck head and finish a run prematurely rather than probing for more interior space. Not always small through the crease. Flashes ability to finish with authority but makes business decisions at times. Hips not as fluid as expected. Would benefit from use of a hearty stiff-arm. Inconsistent hands in all phases. Ball security issues with 13 career fumbles. Suffers from focus drops out of backfield. Won't square-up on blitzers and may not be reliable enough as blocker to play on third downs. 
Ball security ; Must cut down on fumbles ; His power and yards after contact will probably be diminished in the NFL ; Teams worry about off-the-field trouble stemming his friends and entourage ;Summary:  Cook was an impactful player for the Seminoles from his first day with the program. As a freshman, he beat out more experienced backs to be the feature runner who replaced Devonta Freeman. With Jameis Winston under center, Cook turned in an excellent true freshman season in 2014, averaging 5.9 yards per carry for 1,008 yards and eight touchdowns. He caught 22 passes for 203 yards, too.",talentedrunner runneroutstanding outstandingbalance balancefootwork footworkburst talented outstanding balance footwork. cooklacks lackspower powermay mayfind

A committed runner with excellent balance who finds yardage that isn't blocked for him. While he has never logged 20 carries in a single game, he has the talent to play on all three downs if he can prove his durability.","Spirited runner with NFL size and speed. Will open creases by varying pace of his runs. Burst to top speed is available at flip of a switch. Creates yardage with speed, wiggle and power. Twitchy and decisive. Strong lower body provides superior balance. Flexible and agile with ability to twist, spin and ricochet off of bodies and continue to gain yards after contact. Very productive; 23 touchdowns in just 284 touches at Tennessee. Well-liked inside program and a team leader. Can play on all three downs. Improved in pass protection and squares up blitzers.

Not an instinctive runner. Needs to see running lane develop and is missing a feel for reading progressions of his blocks. Makes inconsistent decisions on stretch plays. Can be his own worst enemy on third level. Will run himself into a tackler rather than setting him up for a downfield blocker. Consistently cuts left when given an open-field choice against tackler.

Can he handle a big work load of carries in the NFL? ; Never was the feature back for an entire season ; Quick, but not overly fast and can be caught from behind ;Summary:  The SEC is a run-based conference that plays a lot of smash-mouth football, and Kamara was a standout running back for two of the conference’s legendary programs. There is no doubt that he is a quick, athletic and versatile back who has play-making potential for the NFL. ;Kamara started out his career at Alabama. He had an arrest for a traffic violation and had a warrant issued after failing to appear in court, but NFL teams say that there is nothing to really worry about Kamara off the field. He ended up leaving Alabama primarily because the program had a crowded backfield and he wanted to see the field sooner. Prior to Kamara’s leaving, Nick Saban heaped praise on Kamara, and even after Kamara left, Saban said they knew that Kamara was a real talent with special ability. Kamara landed at Tennessee where he formed a dangerous tandem with power back Jalen Hurd. ;In 2015, Kamara averaged 6.5 yards per carry for 698 yards with seven touchdowns. He showed his receiving skills with 34 receptions for 291 yards with three scores. As a junior, Kamara was excellent at the start of the year and eventually Hurd quit the team. In 2016, Kamara averaged 5.8 yards per carry for 596 yards and nine scores. He also caught 40 passes for 392 yards and four scores. The juniot averaged 9.7 yards per punt return per well. ;As a runner, Kamara is a play-maker. He is quick, sudden, and a threat to rip off a chunk run on any touch. Kamara has moves in the open field to juke defenders or weave around them with excellent cutting ability. He also has a quick step to break into the open field. Kamara possesses vision, cutting ability, and runs with excellent knee bend to stay behind his pads. While he isn’t the biggest of backs, he has a quality build and weight to help him take hits. ;The NFL is a passing-driven league, and Kamara fits it perfectly in that regard as he is a tremendous receiving back. As a receiver, he has soft hands and is a very good route-runner. Kamara could end up being one of the better receiving backs in the NFL. Tennessee would line him up as a slot receiver, and he was excellent in that role. He also was solid as a blocker. Kamara is an excellent returner on special teams, but as a pro, he probably won’t be called on to do that because his team will want to protect him. ;In the NFL, Kamara isn’t the biggest of backs to take on a huge work load of carries. He does run the ball well between the tackles, but he was never the feature back in college. There is doubt around the league that Kamara can handle being a 20-carry-per-game back and hold up for a whole season. Some scouts feel that Kamara would be better as a rotational back and more of the feature back in the passing offense. ;Here is how one top scout expressed the concerns on Kamara, “He just has no track record of being THE guy and handling the load for a stretch. There’s a poor history trying to project part time guys as lead backs in the NFL: Reggie Bush, Ronnie Brown, Laurence Maroney, Felix Jones for instance were just as dynamic if not better as college players and had even more tape than Kamara did, and they all struggled making that transition. It’s harder projecting to a 16-game schedule (let alone an extensive career) for running backs that haven’t done it majority of their collegiate careers. There’s always an outlier so it’s a “never say never” situation. To me, he’s a 2, and I would feel good about getting him in that range as a pick. That’s a good second-round pick for any team employing that role. That would be his best best. Get in a situation where he can replicate what he’s been doing already, prove/grow into more extensive role being the goal.” ;If Kamara goes to a team with a good offensive line and quarterback, he could provide an immediate impact and be a difference-maker. Kamara could go late in the first round, but the second round seems like his most likely destination.",TENNESSEE,67,RB,New Orleans Saints,2017,"Ascending, competitive runner who has flashed explosive NFL talent at various times over the last two seasons.

Christian McCaffrey,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/christian-mccaffrey/32004d43-4303-5988-790d-0077d6a4692b,"Multidimensional runner with flex appeal for teams looking for a player who can carry the ball 20 times or catch it 10 depending on the game plan. McCaffrey's size, power and speed are just average, but he is able to create yardage for himself with his vision and elusiveness. McCaffrey's ability to return punts and kicks could be the value sweetner that pushes his name into the first round.","Smooth, controlled stride length with choppy feet for instant cuts and change of direction. Plus vision with above average anticipatory feel for opening creases. Hugs contours of the running lane and staggers and stutters his feet to maneuver in tight quarters. Protect football while running through traffic. Reads keys quickly on stretch plays. Sinks hips into sharp cuts. Equally adept darting inside or outside and is able to string moves together. Won't dance on short runs -- gets it downhill. Feet constantly in motion. Able to make defenders miss on all three levels. Willing to keep runs playside and alters his track seamlessly. Runs with multiple gears and is able to gear up or down instantly. Has experience in one-back, two-back and offset formations. Excellent hands out of backfield and can be used from slot. Devastating quickness out of breaks can mismatch linebackers. Experienced, capable punt and kick returner.

Has some tread worn off his tires. Logged 300-plus touches (including returns) in each of the last two seasons and was asked to grind the gears for short yardage carries. Benefitted from physical, downhill offensive line. Takes foot off gas into contact. Doesn't have NFL-caliber power to break tackles and create yardage for himself through power. Can shake tacklers, but lacks a twitchy burst to accelerate away after the cut. On stretch plays, can get too cute continuing to probe towards the perimeter rather than choosing a crease and committing. Average burst may not be enough to race past NFL speed on second level. Inconsistent squaring up blitzers in pass pro and ducks his head into contact. 
Lacks ideal bulk ; Can he handle a big work load of carries in the NFL? ; Some teammates don’t like how he pushes them ;Summary:  McCaffrey spent the last two season as one of the most consistent and devastating running backs in college football. In this writer’s opinion, McCaffrey should have won the 2015 Heisman Trophy because he carried Stanford while Alabama’s Derrick Henry had tons of pro talent around him on both sides of the ball. Still, both players had great seasons. McCaffrey averaged six yards per carry that season on his way 2,019 yards with eight touchdowns. As a receiver, he had 45 catches for 645 yards and five scores.",STANFORD,8,RB,Carolina Panthers,2017,"Multidimensional runner with flex appeal for teams looking for a player who can carry the ball 20 times or catch it 10 depending on the game plan.

Joe Mixon,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joe-mixon/32004d49-5856-4388-c611-05b6fcff1d1d,"I've decided to give Joe Mixon a draft grade based on his talent and expected output if given a chance as an NFL running back. His draft slot will likely be impacted by his domestic violence issue. Mixon has the talent to be an every-down, all-day running back with the potential to take over a game on the ground or through the air. Life against weaker Big 12 defenses has created a more relaxed rushing approach for Mixon who will have to play at a faster pace as an NFL back. Mixon's vision is just average and he could struggle to create for himself in front of a subpar offensive line; however, he can play in any rushing scheme and can be moved all over the field as a matchup option.","Outstanding burst to go from first level to third level. Goes from glide to burst quickly and can hit chunk plays between tackles and around corners. Can go from elusive to banger when he needs to. Will drop the pads and drive through tacklers in short yardage spots. Flashy feet for his size. Can jump-cut around defenders in tight quarters. Smooth hips help him swivel around the second and third levels. Able to show and go leaving linebackers diving as he escapes out of the side door. Strong stiff-arm helps would-be tacklers catch grass stains. Can turn the corner and create a straightaway to the end zone. Was Big 12 leader in percentage of explosive carries (15-plus yards) at 11.9 percent. True three-down back. Devastating pass catching option. Excellent route runner creating immediate separation. Soft hands to make the easy catch and the one-hander. Will step in and square up his blocking responsibilities in pass game.

Gallman has limited instincts as an interior runner and needs lanes rather than creases, but he's physical enough to bang out tough yardage. Gallman runs with pace and shows traits of being a one-cut runner who is better off with focused, pre-set tracks rather than searching for his own. He could be an early contributor in a committee with a future as an eventual starter.","Has quality burst through line of scrimmage to rip through arm tackles and attack the second level. Runs with plus effort every time he touches the ball. Keeps feet grinding through second level contact. Uses shoulders as legitimate weapons of force against would-be tacklers. Creates additional yards through functional wiggle. Good outside-in cuts to defeat contain. Angular runner with build-up speed to win a race around the edge. Hard charging. Trusted option on fourth and short situations. Decisive in the red zone and brings some attitude with him. Finished with 28 rushing touchdowns over last two seasons. Strong second effort near the goal line when his initial charge is stopped. Will offer some help as pass catcher. 
Quick feet ; Lateral quickness ; Excellent jump cut ; Quality burst going North-South ; Has some elusiveness ; Fluid at the second level ; Will power the ball for tough yards ; Finishes runs well ; Good check down receiver ; Good fit for a zone-blocking system","Leggy, long-strider. Unable to make sharp, sudden cuts in tight quarters. Extended gear down could cause NFL holes to close on him. Vision becomes restricted when running between tackles. Gives away three sure yards searching along riskier lanes. Lacks finesse in his game. Has bull in china shop running style between tackles. Upright in approach to line of scrimmage. Will allow tacklers under his pads too often. Gets impatient and won't always keep the track behind lead blocker. Below average balance. Can be upended by shoe-string attempts. Not ready for NFL pass protection duties yet. 
Jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none-type back ; Runs upright ; Could have injuries and durability problems because of upright running ; Has already had at least one concussion ; Seemed worn down as a junior ; Good size, but not elite ; Good speed, but not elite ; Will have to learn NFL blitz protection ; Knee bend is lacking ; Pad level is too high ;Summary:  While Deshaun Watson got all the attention in acclaim during Clemson’s big 2015 season, Gallman was a workhorse for the Tigers. In 2015, he was one of the best backs in college football, averaging 5.4 yards per carry for 1,527 yards with 13 touchdowns. He also caught 21 passes for 213 yards with a score. ;Clemson’s rushing offense sputtered somewhat in 2016 as Gallman was banged up throughout the season. He had a concussion that caused him to miss some time, and looked worn down compared to the 2015 season. On the year, Gallman averaged 5.1 yards per carry for 1,087 yards with 16 touchdowns. He tacked on 17 receptions for 113 yards as well. ;As a runner, Gallman was at his best as a sophomore. He showed some impressive feet with the ability to be elusive in the open field. He has tremendous lateral quickness to dodge tacklers and a burst to accelerate running North-South. Many taller backs can’t jump cut and move so fluidly in the second level, but Gallman has that ability. That lets him make a lot of tacklers miss and keeps moving the ball downfield. ;In 2015, Gallman showed some power to him to pound the ball for some tough yards and finish off runs. Consistently, there are plays where Gallman looks like he’s going to be stopped, but he’s able to fight for more yards. Gallman is a tough goal-line back and could be even more powerful after he spends some time in a NFL strength and conditioning program. ;In the passing game, Gallman is a nice option as a check-down target given how skilled he is at ripping off yards in the open field. Like all college backs, Gallman will need to be tutored on blitz protection before he can truly be a three-down starter as a pro. ;With his upright running style, Gallman could be susceptible to injuries and hard hits in the NFL. He looks like he would be best as a rotational NFL back and may not be able to hold up as a three-down starter. In the 2017 NFL Draft, Gallman will probably be a mid-round pick.",CLEMSON,129,RB,New York Giants,2017,"Comes with NFL-ready body and a competitive running style.

Runs with plus effort every time he touches the ball. Keeps feet grinding through second level contact. Uses shoulders as legitimate weapons of force against would-be tacklers. Creates additional yards through functional wiggle. Good outside-in cuts to defeat contain. Angular runner with build-up speed to win a race around the edge. Hard charging. Trusted option on fourth and short situations. Decisive in the red zone and brings some attitude with him. Finished with 28 rushing touchdowns over last two seasons. Strong second effort near the goal line when his initial charge is stopped. Will offer some help as pass catcher. 
Quick feet ; Lateral quickness ; Excellent jump cut ; Quality burst going North-South ; Has some elusiveness ; Fluid at the second level ; Will power the ball for tough yards ; Finishes runs well ; Good check down receiver ; Good fit for a zone-blocking system Leggy, long-strider. Unable to make sharp, sudden cuts in tight quarters. Extended gear down could cause NFL holes to close on him. Vision becomes restricted when running between tackles. Gives away three sure yards searching along riskier lanes. Lacks finesse in his game. Has bull in china shop running style between tackles. Upright in approach to line of scrimmage. Will allow tacklers under his pads too often. Gets impatient and won't always keep the track behind lead blocker. Below average balance. Can be upended by shoe-string attempts. Not ready for NFL pass protection duties yet. 
Jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none-type back ; Runs upright ; Could have injuries and durability problems because of upright running ; Has already had at least one concussion ; Seemed worn down as a junior ; Good size, but not elite ; Good speed, but not elite ; Will have to learn NFL blitz protection ; Knee bend is lacking ; Pad level is too high ;Summary:  While Deshaun Watson got all the attention in acclaim during Clemson’s big 2015 season, Gallman was a workhorse for the Tigers. In 2015, he was one of the best backs in college football, averaging 5.4 yards per carry for 1,527 yards with 13 touchdowns. He also caught 21 passes for 213 yards with a score. ;Clemson’s rushing offense sputtered somewhat in 2016 as Gallman was banged up throughout the season. He had a concussion that caused him to miss some time, and looked worn down compared to the 2015 season. On the year, Gallman averaged 5.1 yards per carry for 1,087 yards with 16 touchdowns. He tacked on 17 receptions for 113 yards as well. ;As a runner, Gallman was at his best as a sophomore. He showed some impressive feet with the ability to be elusive in the open field. He has tremendous lateral quickness to dodge tacklers and a burst to accelerate running North-South. Many taller backs can’t jump cut and move so fluidly in the second level, but Gallman has that ability. That lets him make a lot of tacklers miss and keeps moving the ball downfield. ;In 2015, Gallman showed some power to him to pound the ball for some tough yards and finish off runs. Consistently, there are plays where Gallman looks like he’s going to be stopped, but he’s able to fight for more yards. Gallman is a tough goal-line back and could be even more powerful after he spends some time in a NFL strength and conditioning program. ;In the passing game, Gallman is a nice option as a check-down target given how skilled he is at ripping off yards in the open field. Like all college backs, Gallman will need to be tutored on blitz protection before he can truly be a three-down starter as a pro. ;With his upright running style, Gallman could be susceptible to injuries and hard hits in the NFL. He looks like he would be best as a rotational NFL back and may not be able to hold up as a three-down starter. In the 2017 NFL Draft, Gallman will probably be a mid-round pick.",comesbody bodycompetitive competitiverunning runningstyle comes body competitive style. gallmanlimited limitedinstincts

While he has good burst and quickness, he does lack the home-run speed expected from such small running backs. He won't even be an option for teams married to physical minimums, but there is a place on the roster for his talent provided he can become a return man or viable receiving option as well.","Produced at high levels. Patient but decisive when he sees it. Accesses instant turbo burst. Rarely loses races to and around the edge. Plus vision creates ability to navigate shifting run creases like a seasoned veteran. Slaloms through traffic from side to side with seamless, tight jump cuts. Keeps tight track through the gaps, maintaining distance from defensive linemen. Able to string moves together. Razor-sharp cutbacks at challenging angles are his thing. Made a rare 90-degree cut out of a downhill run against South Alabama. Excels in outside zone but has courage to stick it between tackles. Extremely elusive in open field after catch. Used as matchup weapon out of backfield. Good route runner who creates necessary separation.","Undersized. Lacks the leg thickness and overall physical strength desired out of an NFL running back. Spirit is willing but flesh is weak. Arm tackles are able to end his journey. Willing to accelerate into defender, but doesn't have the pop to break tackles or fall forward after contact. Quicker than fast. Will get caught from behind.

He won't even be an option for teams married to physical minimums, but there is a place on the roster for his talent provided he can become a return man or viable receiving option as well. Produced at high levels. Patient but decisive when he sees it. Accesses instant turbo burst. Rarely loses races to and around the edge. Plus vision creates ability to navigate shifting run creases like a seasoned veteran. Slaloms through traffic from side to side with seamless, tight jump cuts. Keeps tight track through the gaps, maintaining distance from defensive linemen. Able to string moves together. Razor-sharp cutbacks at challenging angles are his thing. Made a rare 90-degree cut out of a downhill run against South Alabama. Excels in outside zone but has courage to stick it between tackles. Extremely elusive in open field after catch. Used as matchup weapon out of backfield. Good route runner who creates necessary separation. Undersized. Lacks the leg thickness and overall physical strength desired out of an NFL running back. Spirit is willing but flesh is weak. Arm tackles are able to end his journey. Willing to accelerate into defender, but doesn't have the pop to break tackles or fall forward after contact. Quicker than fast. Will get caught from behind. Body catcher with average hands that lead to double catches. Too small to protect against NFL blitzers as third-down back.",pumphreyefficient efficientnatural naturalback backruns runsoutstanding outstandingtempo tempovision pumphrey efficient natural

Saquon Barkley,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/saquon-barkley/32004241-5219-2674-af43-1519254e563d,"Every-down running back with the ability to alter the course of an offense and become a face of the franchise-type player. Barkley has the rare ability to create additional yardage through elusiveness, speed, vision and feel for space in the open field. While he has been tasked with carrying a heavy load at Penn State, their decision to limit his carries somewhat this season could help Barkley headed into his rookie season. Barkley is a buffet runner who thrives with the more plates you give him and he has a chance to become an early All-Pro no matter which team takes him.","Compact frame carries muscular, powerful trunk. High tempo runner with urgent underpinnings as his core. Offensive lineman's best friend with talent to dismiss penetration with deft footwork. Runs with optimal pad level. Elite wiggle triggered by fluid hips. Knee bend and quick-twitch powers sudden stops paired with aggressive jump cuts and spin moves to leave tacklers hanging. Can alter the course of the run whenever he wants. Presses line of scrimmage to give himself ample time to make his reads. Vision is solid. Keeps eyes darting when navigating interior running lanes. Exploits voided cutback lanes. Lateral burst and agility are top-notch. Has plant-and-go burst to rocket around the corner when needed. Good feel for managing distance between himself and defenders once he finds an opening. Feet are in constant motion and he rarely gears down to change direction in open field. Capable pass catcher. Effective separator in his routes. Beats up linebackers on wheel routes. Very tough and very competitive. Added two kick returns for touchdowns this year and will do what he must to help his team win. Football character and personal character are impeccable.

Derrius Guice,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/derrius-guice/32004755-4907-4673-ed5d-0dca81c2e6f3,"Evaluating Guice requires settling in for two full seasons of tape study as he was only healthy a fraction of the 2017 season. While Guice has some elusiveness and long speed, much of his success comes from his furious running style and ability to create yardage after contact. Guice's yards per touch was two yards higher over his first two seasons compared to last year. Like Leonard Fournette the year before, teams may be willing to lock in on his sophomore tape to create their evaluations and grades. Guice's running style could lead to a shorter career, but he has a chance to make a big splash early.","Completely different talent on healthy 2016 tape as opposed to injured 2017. Well built combining powerful lower body with good overall size. Winning combination of speed, power and balance. Good recognition of early trouble from penetration and makes alterations. Has quality vision and is able to make sudden cuts without rolling into low gear. Rarely rushes as interior runner. Sets up blocks and follows the plan. Gathers weight quickly after cuts and re-establishes his base. Exceptional contact balance carrying power to punish second-level tacklers. Can create his own fortune. Has footwork and athleticism to spin out of tackle attempts. Able to push piles. Shows ability to impose his will in the fourth quarter. Angle tackles won't get it done. Possesses homerun capability when he finds open field. Not a classic third-down back, but can pick up patches of yards out of backfield.
Impactful feature back ; Instinctive, natural runner ; Downhill runner ; Tough to tackle ; Picks up yards after contact ; Excellent body lean to run low ; Runs behind pads ; Bends at the knee ; Keeps feet going after contact ; Has a second gear in the open field ; Fast to the hole ; Play-maker ; Good vision ; Wears down defenses ; Impressive lateral quickness ; Has elusiveness in the open field ; Decisive runner ; Capable of creating for himself ; Can handle a big workload ; Capable of controlling games ; Runs well in the second half ; Quality short-yardage back ; Can change the complexion of an offense as a play-making runner ; Athletic upside","Dealt with recurring injury issues that short-circuited production throughout 2017 season. Needs to be more decisive through the line of scrimmage as a pro. Burst is just average. May not have enough juice to win races around the edge. Needs to do better job of dropping pad level at impact rather than just ducking helmet into contact as a weapon. Will opt to finish rather than spying additional opportunities at times.

Slow out of his breaks as receiver. Needs to body up in pass pro. 
Had knee-injury issues during 2017 season ; Not overly fast ; Not overly powerful ;Summary:  Over the past three seasons, Guice has shown that he has serious running talent. Guice averaged 8.5 yards per carry as a freshman in 2015 for 436 yards with three touchdowns. With Leonard Fournette in and out of the lineup with an ankle injury in 2016, Guice took advantage of a larger-than-expected workload to have a breakout sophomore season. He averaged 7.6 yards per carry for 1,387 yards with 15 touchdowns. As a receiver, Guice had nine receptions for 106 yards. ;Guice was expected to be one of the top rushers in the nation in 2017, but he was held back for a lot of the season with a knee injury. The junior missed only one game, but he wasn’t the same in other contests. Still, Guice turned in some big performances, including 276 yards on 22 carries against Ole Miss. Guice averaged 5.3 yards per carry in 2017, totaling 1,251 yards with 11 touchdowns. He had 18 catches for 124 yards and two touchdowns as well. At the NFL Scouting Combine, Guice showed impressive speed, running a 4.49-second in the 40-yard dash. That is a fast time for a running back and especially one for a back that carries as much weight as Guice does. ;Guice is an interesting player with diversity in his skill set. One could debate on the kind of back he will be in the NFL, but the end result is that he has elements of power and quickness to be a well-balanced runner. There are times at which you see impressive power to lower a shoulder and blast a defender. While Guice finishes his runs dishing out some punishment, he is a tough runner between the tackles as well, and his legs don’t go dead on contact when bigger defenders hit him or get a hold of him. Guice will run through tackles, break free from defenders, and is tough to get on the ground.",LSU,59,RB,Washington Commanders,2018,"Evaluating Guice requires settling in for two full seasons of tape study as he was only healthy a fraction of the 2017 season. While Guice has some elusiveness and long speed, much of his success comes from his furious running style and ability to create yardage after contact. Guice's yards per touch was two yards higher over his first two seasons compared to last year. Like Leonard Fournette the year before, teams may be willing to lock in on his sophomore tape to create their evaluations and grades. Guice's running style could lead to a shorter career, but he has a chance to make a big splash early. Completely different talent on healthy 2016 tape as opposed to injured 2017. Well built combining powerful lower body with good overall size. Winning combination of speed, power and balance. Good recognition of early trouble from penetration and makes alterations. Has quality vision and is able to make sudden cuts without rolling into low gear. Rarely rushes as interior runner. Sets up blocks and follows the plan. Gathers weight quickly after cuts and re-establishes his base. Exceptional contact balance carrying power to punish second-level tacklers. Can create his own fortune. Has footwork and athleticism to spin out of tackle attempts. Able to push piles. Shows ability to impose his will in the fourth quarter. Angle tackles won't get it done. Possesses homerun capability when he finds open field. Not a classic third-down back, but can pick up patches of yards out of backfield.
Impactful feature back ; Instinctive, natural runner ; Downhill runner ; Tough to tackle ; Picks up yards after contact ; Excellent body lean to run low ; Runs behind pads ; Bends at the knee ; Keeps feet going after contact ; Has a second gear in the open field ; Fast to the hole ; Play-maker ; Good vision ; Wears down defenses ; Impressive lateral quickness ; Has elusiveness in the open field ; Decisive runner ; Capable of creating for himself ; Can handle a big workload ; Capable of controlling games ; Runs well in the second half ; Quality short-yardage back ; Can change the complexion of an offense as a play-making runner ; Athletic upside Dealt with recurring injury issues that short-circuited production throughout 2017 season. Needs to be more decisive through the line of scrimmage as a pro. Burst is just average. May not have enough juice to win races around the edge. Needs to do better job of dropping pad level at impact rather than just ducking helmet into contact as a weapon. Will opt to finish rather than spying additional opportunities at times. Has some hip tightness and needs additional room to elude tacklers when rolling downhill. Takes his fair share of heavy hits. Needs his reps to understand concepts. Slow out of his breaks as receiver. Needs to body up in pass pro.

Ronald Jones,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ronald-jones/32004a4f-4e70-5925-2b49-5f67cfbf7e05,"Jones is a classic slasher with the wiggle and explosiveness to elude open-field tacklers and then burst to chunks of yardage. Jones was a much more assertive runner in 2017 and improved upon areas of improvement from the 2016 season. Jones also has the ability to turn into a much more dangerous pass-catcher than we saw at USC. He should test well at the Combine, but there will still be teams concerned with how many carries he can handle and how that affects his draft value. He's a big play talent with a chance to thrive at a high level wherever he lands.","Runs with desired level of calm in the face of oncoming traffic. Trusts blocking development and hides cut intentions until the last second. Plays with light, electric feet that are dynamic in tight quarters. Elite plant and acceleration. Loose hips able to make rare cuts as sharp as 90 degrees. Deadly stop-start to ruin linebackers trying to pace and mirror him. Can find side door out of traffic and to the outside track. Maintains top play speed and is able to string together moves on moves on moves. Has lower body wiggle to dead-leg tackle attempts and slide by defender. Willful as a runner. Squares pads at impact for improved contact balance. Fights for yardage and falls forward. Had just two fumbles over 591 carries. Wasn't prolific as pass-catcher but is more than capable. Willing to stand in and offer some blitz protection.
Fast back ; Very good first-step quickness ; Explosiveness to the second level; Deep speed; can take runs the distance ; Difficult to catch from behind ; Slashing runner ; Excellent feet; Elusiveness in the open field ; Cutting ability ; Keeps feet going after contact ; Finishes runs well ; Impressive lateral quickness ; Good route-runner ; Soft hands ; Became a decisive North-South runner ; Athletic upside","Relatively lean frame. Could require limitations with his touch count over the course of a season. Coming off of a 275-touch 2017 campaign. Interior vision can be a little inconsistent and will leave meat on the bone. Lacks a broad base and contact balance could become an issue on next level. Reactive runner who could still use a more fine-tuned rush plan. Needs to balance pace with patience. Can get too far downhill leaving himself limited escape routes. Has room for improvement with run track in gap scheme. Can improve tempo and rhythm to set up cutbacks on stretch plays. Takes too many punishing blows in his quest for additional yardage. 
Runs a little upright ; Thinner build ; Could use more weight for the NFL ; May have a hard time holding up under a big work load ;Summary:  While other backs have gotten more attention, Jones was one of the more consistent and steady runners in college football over the past three seasons.

Sony Michel,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/sony-michel/32004d49-4351-7884-c6be-b720a5a54649,"Michel is a well-built, no-nonsense runner who is able to combine vision, burst, and physicality. While he can make open field cuts to find additional yardage, his running style is more angular in nature and he thrives when playing north-south. He's not the most creative runner and he lacks some finesse, but his size, pass protection and ability to create yardage make him a natural fit as a future NFL starter.","Muscular, well-proportioned frame. Decisive runner who rarely takes unnecessary losses by trying to be the hero. Runs with discipline and looks for the optimal path. Able to gather and cut quickly as inside zone and gap runner. Has good burst after cuts. Flashes acceleration to climb past linebackers and onto safeties quickly. Six of his touchdown runs went for 16 yards or more this year. Stout lower body can rip through arm tackles and allows for plus balance through contact. Has good open field vision to extend runs with second level moves, but will drop his pads and meet force with force when it's time to finish. Understands the art of setting up lead blockers and pulling guards. Highly respected, vocal leader. Excellent in blitz pickup. Understands his blocking responsibilities and will square up and take on rushers. Two-year captain.

Lack of agility precludes him from making late cuts to elude incoming tacklers. Low knee action in early stages of the run causes him to trip over blockers feet when trying to squeeze through tight running lanes. More angular runner than one who can make sharp cuts. Had some huge rushing lanes to work with thanks to scheme and improved blocking in 2017. Open field balance is inconsistent. Plays with a head-down, raging-bull mentality in short yardage and needs to improve his feel for finding creases. Will duck head and finish prematurely if he doesn't see an early opening to work with. Serviceable as pass catcher, but has had issues catching it cleanly.
Not overly powerful ; Never handled a big work load as the feature back ;Summary:  Michel was the forgotten man for a lot of his time at Georgia. At most schools, he would have been an immediate starter and a superstar back. However with the Bulldogs fielding a prolific stable of running backs, it took a lot of time for Michel to show that he is an impact-creating back in his own right. ;In his freshman season, Michel was behind Todd Gurley and Nick Chubb on the depth chart and had only 64 carries, although he turned those into 410 yards and five touchdown. In Michel’s sophomore season, Gurley was in the NFL and Chubb went down with a knee injury partway through the year. That season Michel gave his largest carry total with 219. He averaged 5.3 yards per carry in 2015 for 1,161 yards and eight touchdowns.",GEORGIA,31,RB,New England Patriots,2018,"Michel is a well-built, no-nonsense runner who is able to combine vision, burst, and physicality.

Kerryon Johnson,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kerryon-johnson/32004a4f-4839-9188-cb7b-f29b5ea64839,"Has unusual build for the position with a linear frame and thin hips. Johnson proved that he was more than tough enough to carry a heavy workload to help Auburn impose their will on the ground. Johnson runs with good burst and is adept as both an inside and outside runner, but is more likely to become a grinder than a slasher on the next level. Johnson offers three-down value and could become an early starter, but his frame may not be able to hold up over the long haul if he's forced into high carry totals.","All-State basketball player in high school who plays with fast feet. Has instant burst to rocket through the line and onto the second level. Gear shifter with access to a variety of speeds. Accelerates around edge defender and then gears down for downhill cut. Uses strong stiff-arm to dump angle tackles. Runs with juice and courage inside. Showed toughness and heart as a banger in upset win over Alabama. Creates with burst and physicality. Never gives in and squeezes everything he can from the run. Pinball back with the churning feet and contact balance to carom off tacklers and restart the run. More likely the hammer than nail when finishing. Goes from bursting to eluding to making the tackler feel it. Third down option who understands protections and rarely busts. Looks to square up one-on-one targets and has toughness to become even better in NFL. Effective on screens, swings and check-downs. Adjusts to throws outside his frame.

Rashaad Penny,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rashaad-penny/32005045-4e50-4753-3f3f-c08ffd9467b0,"Volume-carry running back who plays with an active running style that rarely sees him slow his feet. Penny has the short-area foot quickness to create yardage for himself, but he doesn't really have the burst or long speed to be a homerun hitter. His motor gives him a chance to be a productive NFL starter, but he may lack the explosiveness to be a great back.","Has desired NFL size for an every-down running back. Runs with short, controlled strides allowing him to elude sudden tackle attempts and alter his rush track. Able to alter pursuit angles with his movement. Will give ground to get ground around the corner. Presses line of scrimmage with conviction before making his cuts. Patient runner who is extremely effective at running defenders into trouble by setting up his blockers for success before cutting off of their blocks. Uses both subtle and aggressive fakes in space to hinder the tackler's ability to square him up. Arm tacklers won't cut it. Runs with strong lower half and swivels hips and shakes takes off of his lower body. Has slasher qualities as a runner. Finishes with a lower shoulder into tacklers when he's finishing. Posted impressive kick return numbers. Has averaged 31.9 yards per kickoff return with seven touchdowns over last three seasons. Sets up kick return blocks the same way he sets them up as a runner. 
Surprising speed for a big back ; Quickness to the hole and second level ; Has the speed to break off long runs ; Size to be a power back ; Quick feet ; Impressive vision ; Good balance ; Runs decisively between the tackles ; Physical downhill runner ; Dangerous receiver in the open field ; Quality route runner ; Quality hands ; Instinctive runner ; Potential third-down back ; Kick returner ; Could be a nice contributor on special teams ; Durable ; Athletic upside","High-cut, upright runner. Despite urgency as a runner, won't break many quality tackle attempts. One-speed runner without a big burst gear to clear first and second level defenders cleanly. Has modest yards after first contact numbers over the last two seasons. Can get a little ""bounce-happy"" with his willingness to try and cut inside runs to the outside once he gets onto second level. Doesn't always show a feel for the best run lane choices. Will miss backside, cutback lanes. May not have the long speed to pull away from tacklers and hit big chunk runs. Scouts say he may need additional reps to lock-in on the playbook. Needs to improve route-running to become a more effective pass catcher.
Learning issues ; Plays slower when he’s unsure mentally ; Makeup isn’t very good ; Doesn’t have an impressive work ethic ; Sometimes legs go dead on contact ; Needs to improve pass blocking ;Summary:  The 2018 NFL Draft is very strong at the running back position, and Penny is one of those runners who could turn into a starter after being a second-day pick. The NFL wants backs who possess three-down ability with the skills to contribute as runners, receivers and blockers. Teams also are always looking for big backs who have the speed to break off long runs. Penny has the potential to fulfill all of these wishes, and as a result, there should be plenty of teams that consider taking him on the second day of the 2018 NFL Draft. ;Over the past few seasons, Penny was a consistent producer for San Diego State, and as a senior, he was one of the best backs in college football. As a junior, Penny averaged 7.4 yards per carry for 1,005 yards with 11 touchdowns. He caught 15 passes for 224 yards and three scores that season as well. In 2017, Penny dominated the competition while averaging 7.8 yards per carry for 2,248 yards with 23 touchdowns, plus he had 19 receptions for 135 yards and two scores. ;As a back, Penny is a thickly built downhill runner. He has a surprising burst to hit the hole and accelerate to the second level. Penny is fast for a big back and can run away from the defense when he gets to the open field. His second gear is very impressive and makes him dangerous to rip off long runs on any carry. Penny combines quick, feet, good balance, and decisive running to be a dangerous runner for a zone-blocking system.

Nick Chubb,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/nick-chubb/32004348-5503-3942-d8b2-181bd658412e,"Has the size and mindset of a primary ball carrier, but lacks any one element of his game that jumps off the tape when evaluating. Chubb isn't overly elusive, but he does a good job of running through arm tackles and initial contact with lower body strength and contact balance. Chubb could become an average NFL starter, but his lack of third down value may end up hurting his draft stock.","Possesses a low center of gravity and strong base giving him natural balance to help stack yardage after contact. Has some pop behind his pads as a runner. Can attack edge with sudden, lateral cutback if contain falters. Has one-cut ability. Saw foot quickness and burst improve after sluggish 2016, post-injury effort. Has adequate acceleration to the edge and is effective with his off-hand at stiff-arming and separating himself from tacklers in pursuit. Shows proper level of discipline to keep runs between the tackles when called for rather than trying to bounce everything outside. Has footwork and feel to slalom through interior traffic and squeeze out hidden creases near goal line. Patient approach and runs with very little wasted motion. Ball security is a plus.

Already sustained one serious knee injury ; Will need development as a receiver ; Will need development as a blocker ; Medical evaluation could hurt his draft grade ;Summary:  Nobody was expecting a backup freshman running back to take the SEC by storm in 2014, especially when the starting running back was superstar Todd Gurley, but that is exactly what Chubb did. Gurley missed time with a suspension before tearing an ACL, which ended his season early. Chubb was phenomenal as the replacement for Gurley, averaging 7.1 yards per carry for 1,547 yards with 14 touchdowns. He also caught 18 receptions for 213 yards and two scores. ;With Gurley in the NFL in 2015, Chubb took over as the feature back for the Bulldogs and picked up where he left off as a freshman. The sophomore averaged 8.1 yards per carry for 747 yards and seven touchdowns through only five games. He had four receptions for 32 yards and a score as well. In his final complete game of the year, he ran for 146 yards on 20 carries with a touchdown against eventual National Champion Alabama. Chubb tore his ACL against Tennessee in Georgia’s next contest and missed the final seven contests of the season. ;As a junior, Chubb had an impressive start to 2016 when he made it back for the season opener and ripped off 222 yards and two touchdowns on 32 carries against North Carolina. Unfortunately for Chubb, that was his best game of the season, and he didn’t look like the same player over the course of the year. In 2016, Chubb averaged 5.0 yards per carry for 1,130 yards with eight touchdowns. He had five receptions for 86 yards and a touchdown as well.",GEORGIA,35,RB,Cleveland Browns,2018,"Has the size and mindset of a primary ball carrier, but lacks any one element of his game that jumps off the tape when evaluating. Chubb isn't overly elusive, but he does a good job of running through arm tackles and initial contact with lower body strength and contact balance. Chubb could become an average NFL starter, but his lack of third down value may end up hurting his draft stock. Possesses a low center of gravity and strong base giving him natural balance to help stack yardage after contact. Has some pop behind his pads as a runner. Can attack edge with sudden, lateral cutback if contain falters. Has one-cut ability. Saw foot quickness and burst improve after sluggish 2016, post-injury effort. Has adequate acceleration to the edge and is effective with his off-hand at stiff-arming and separating himself from tacklers in pursuit. Shows proper level of discipline to keep runs between the tackles when called for rather than trying to bounce everything outside. Has footwork and feel to slalom through interior traffic and squeeze out hidden creases near goal line. Patient approach and runs with very little wasted motion. Ball security is a plus.

Versatile threat offering creative offensive coordinators a toy to tinker with. Has experience as lone running back and slot receiver. Flashed his homerun potential with touchdown runs of 83, 54, 50, and 48 this season. Most comfortable when he's keeping outside zone carries over the tackle. Build-up speed can eliminate pursuit angles and thrust him into open space for chunk yardage. Quality stiff-arm. Plays with adequate toughness to gain yards after contact.

",Smaller than ideal as a running back. Needs to do better job of sidestepping big hits or face durability concerns. Better athlete than running back and better runner than receiver. Lacks feel for blocking in front of him. Hasn't learned to hug the lane and flow away from traffic just yet. Can be slow to see run lane development allowing defenders a chance to close. Needs to run with more consistent tempo and rhythm in outside zone. Vision stalls when attempting to find cutback lanes. Not a natural pass catcher and has dealt with drops throughout his career.

Most comfortable when he's keeping outside zone carries over the tackle. Build-up speed can eliminate pursuit angles and thrust him into open space for chunk yardage. Quality stiff-arm. Plays with adequate toughness to gain yards after contact. Hands and catch focus showed improvement this season as a receiver. Possesses raw talent waiting to be molded. Has kick and punt return experience and has taken three kicks back for touchdowns. 
 Smaller than ideal as a running back. Needs to do better job of sidestepping big hits or face durability concerns. Better athlete than running back and better runner than receiver. Lacks feel for blocking in front of him. Hasn't learned to hug the lane and flow away from traffic just yet. Can be slow to see run lane development allowing defenders a chance to close. Needs to run with more consistent tempo and rhythm in outside zone. Vision stalls when attempting to find cutback lanes. Not a natural pass catcher and has dealt with drops throughout his career. Needs to improve sink into routes and quickness into his breaks.",hinestalent talentsize sizework workrunning runningback backneed needmuch muchwork workreceiver hines talent size work need much work

Samuels isn't a tight end and has to prove he can handle blocking duties well enough to be a fullback. He will, however, appeal to teams looking to disguise their attacks with more diversified personnel groupings. Samuels best fit may be with a zone-scheme team as a RB/FB with the ability to play slot receiver and become a core special teamer.","Provides roster flexibility thanks to his unique versatility. True ""all-purpose"" player. Used as zone-scheme runner, on jet sweeps, bubble screens, at slot receiver, outside receiver, and in ""Wildcat"" this season. Proved he could handle some running back duties this season. Had success using his size and effort in finding paydirt as goalline running back. Can make first tackler miss in space. Active with off-hand to swipe away arm tackles. Has intelligence to process expansive, individual game plan and take it to the field. Can separate from linebackers looking to cover him from slot. Able to drop low and snare low throws. Has carried more weight in the past and has the frame to do that again if necessary. Provides kick cover talent and has experience returning kickoffs.

Walton has the ability to become a solid backup who can handle a heavier touch load over smaller stretches if needed.,"Short but stout. Has thick, powerful lower body. Runs with knee bend and balance. Loose hips can rotate to find sharp cutback opportunities. Finds yardage for himself when blocking isn't there. More decisive and confident when working from dotted ""I"". Able to hug run lane tight when needed. Good acceleration to the corner. Touchdown maker. Drops pads and gets forward lean into first contact. Effective attacking linebackers out of backfield. Makes initial tackle attempts miss and has burst to turn a short catch into a chunk play. Good ball tracker on wheel routes. Hands are sticky like a wideout. Will stick a stiff shoulder into chip blocks and is willing to stand in against blitzers. Didn't fumble over his last 274 carries. ",Way too much dancing as off-set back. Shows distrust of the blocking plan and will void the rush track early. Takes long looks for clear point of entry rather than finding the crease. Vision and decisiveness as inside runner are below average. Big runs come from bouncing wide. Run strength is average. Uses gather step pre-cut rather than plant-and-go delaying downhill burst.

David Montgomery,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/david-montgomery/32004d4f-4e48-7374-a044-7fb197b6b501,"One of the safest runners in this draft with a desirable combination of size, vision, toughness and creativity. He runs with impressive calm and instincts in the midst of interior mayhem, weaving and battering his way through traffic. Smart teams will recognize his ability to create yardage for himself with his eyes, footwork, contact balance and power. Should alleviate concerns about his lack of explosiveness. Montgomery has a pro-ready game and Day 2 (Rounds 2-3) value as a good NFL starter.
A three-year starter at Iowa State, Montgomery was an every-down back in the Cyclones shotgun, zone-read offense, often flanked to the left/right ofthe quarterback. He benefited from inferior tackling in the Big 12, but he runs with the active feet and ultra-competitive urgency that allows him to break tackles.While elusive in short areas, Montgomery is quicker than fast with inconsistent anticipation (more of a checkers runner, not chess). He has off-the-chart intangibleswith the receiving and blocking potential to fit multiple roles. Overall, Montgomery doesn’t have much “special” to him as an athlete and he needs to see thingsquicker, but he doesn’t concede easily and has the run balance/toughness to be productive.","Compact frame is built for the rigors of his work. Instinctive runner with ability to stack moves. Patient runner with plus vision up to second level. Glides behind his bigs and sets up his blocks. Gears up and down to counter flowing linebackers. Rhythmic but forceful. Offers no easy outs for tacklers. Powerful lower body creates rare contact balance. Adequate agility to elude one tackler and then punish the next. Takes care of the football and rarely fumbles. Plays with shake at the top of his route. Natural hands with ability to pluck it outside his frame. Good blitz recognition in pass pro.
Elusive runner due to his balance, low center and run toughness…good-sized athlete and rarely goes down at first contact…flashes strong leg drive andpowers through arm tackles when he wants to…patient at the line of scrimmage with strong cuts to keep defenders off balance in the hole…vision to find the cutbacklane…easy to appreciate his toughness and nonstop fight…reliable ball skills with focus to stab away from his body…steady base and awareness in pass protection toface-up and keep rushers occupied…only three career fumbles on 695 touches (and never more than one in a season)…named a 2018 team captain and his coachescall him a “culture changer” due to his work ethic, effort and character (Eagle Scout who is very involved in his community)…ranked sixth in school history in careerrushing yards (2,925) and all-purpose yards (3,507).","Heavy workload over the last two seasons.

Miles Sanders,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/miles-sanders/32005341-4e15-3567-869d-79c73965b54e,"Well-built glider with the instincts, footwork and agility to shake tacklers but the frame and pad level to finish with some authority. He can clearly create yardage for himself, but he has average acceleration and might need to expedite his downhill process as a pro. Sanders is more skilled than explosive, but he has the size and talent to develop into a future starter with every-down potential.
A one-year starter at Penn State, Sanders patiently waited his turn behind Saquon Barkley for two seasons before taking over as the starter in the NittanyLions’ RPO-heavy scheme. He finished second in the Big Ten (behind Wisconsin’s Jonathan Taylor) with 1,274 rushing yards in 2018, which was 3j more yards thanBarkley’s 1,271 total in 2017. Although he isn’t naturally explosive and not as likely to juke NFL defenders, Sanders is able to create yardage for himself with hisreactive run style. He is a reliable pass catcher, but must become more dependable as a blocker and cut down on the fumbles for an NFL play-caller to trust him.Overall, Sanders isn’t a sudden athlete or hammer inside, but his combination of awareness, balance and pacing allows him to instinctively sort through the trash,slip tackle attempts and find creases.","Low mileage with just 276 career carries. Built like NFL runner with well-defined lowers and loose hips. Typically patient as a runner. Good vision and quick to process what he sees. Footwork to probe and dart around early traffic. Able to string his moves together. Instinctive with feel for crevices inside the run lane. Lateral agility for slick side-door exits. Runs with forward lean and squared pads. Possesses above-average contact balance and falls forward. Creates through elusiveness and power. Third-down option with decent hands and size to block.
: Looks the part with proportionate build…calculating runner, patiently reading blocks and hitting holes…lower body strength, controlled lateral cuts andnatural balance allow him to squirm out of tackle attempts (3.5 yards after initial contact in 2018)…understands pacing, making tackles a chore for defenders…doesn’tseek out contact, but it doesn’t bother him either…uses his peripherals to find the cutback lane…natural receiving traits, adjusting his frame with soft hands to catchand go…wasn’t worn down by excessive touches in college…averaged 108.7 yards of total offense (fourth best in the Big Ten) in his lone season as a starter.
Excellent at keeping his legs going after contact ; Picks up yards after contact ; Breaks tackles ; Good feet ; Quick to the second level ; Tough to tackle at the second level ; Runs behind pads ; Bends at the knee ; Cutting ability ; Has some elusiveness as a runner ; Receiving ability ; Good vision ; Decisive runner ; Good build ; Runs good routes ; Potential three-down starter ; Dangerous one-cut downhill runner","Never eclipsed 51 rushing yards against Kentucky, Ohio State or Michigan. Needs to run with more plant-and-go mentality. Gets too cute in the hole at times. Lacks explosiveness and speed to the corner. Average access to burst after a cut. No home-run speed in open field. Doesn't separate from linebackers on wheel routes. Chip blocks lack commitment. Ball security appears to be an issue. 
His cuts have bounce, but not organic explosion…relies more on timing-pacing than burst to shake defenders…prefers to sidestep contact rather thanpower through it…runs tough, but more finesse than expected…late to get north-south on outside runs…ball security was an issue with nine fumbles on only 308offensive touches (fumbled once every 34.2 touches)…offers blocking upside, but needs to improve his awareness and urgency in pass protection…only one season asthe full-time back.
One-year starter ; Good speed, but not elite ; Will need development in blitz protection ;Summary:  The night after the running back prospects worked out at the NFL Scouting Combine, WalterFootball.com caught up with two running back coaches, one from an AFC playoff team and one from a NFC playoff team. Independently, they both named the same three running backs as players who impressed them during the field workout. They were Ohio State’s Mike Weber, Penn State’s Miles Sanders and Michigan State’s L.J. Scott. ;Sanders had a very fast 40 time of 4.49 seconds at the combine. The coaches also liked how he looked in the field work. Sanders showed athleticism and quick feet with cutting ability beyond his fast 40 time. After serving as the backup to Saquon Barkley early in his career, in his senior year, Sanders averaged 5.8 yards per carry for 1,274 yards with nine touchdowns. ;Sanders has three-down starting potential for the NFL. What really stands out about and makes him unique is what an excellent job he does of keeping his legs going after contact. Sanders uses that to break tackles and accelerate downfield when it looks like he is going to be stopped. He is also tough to tackle at the second level as he runs through contact. Sanders’ knee bend and leverage allow him to run behind his pads and power through arm tackles. On top of his excellent feet, Sanders has some elusiveness in the open field as he can cut to weave his way around defenders. Sanders has a good jump cut and lateral quickness to dodge would-be tacklers.",PENN STATE,53,RB,Philadelphia Eagles,2019,"Well-built glider with the instincts, footwork and agility to shake tacklers but the frame and pad level to finish with some authority.

: Looks the part with proportionate build…calculating runner, patiently reading blocks and hitting holes…lower body strength, controlled lateral cuts andnatural balance allow him to squirm out of tackle attempts (3.5 yards after initial contact in 2018)…understands pacing, making tackles a chore for defenders…doesn’tseek out contact, but it doesn’t bother him either…uses his peripherals to find the cutback lane…natural receiving traits, adjusting his frame with soft hands to catchand go…wasn’t worn down by excessive touches in college…averaged 108.7 yards of total offense (fourth best in the Big Ten) in his lone season as a starter.
Excellent at keeping his legs going after contact ; Picks up yards after contact ; Breaks tackles ; Good feet ; Quick to the second level ; Tough to tackle at the second level ; Runs behind pads ; Bends at the knee ; Cutting ability ; Has some elusiveness as a runner ; Receiving ability ; Good vision ; Decisive runner ; Good build ; Runs good routes ; Potential three-down starter ; Dangerous one-cut downhill runner Never eclipsed 51 rushing yards against Kentucky, Ohio State or Michigan. Needs to run with more plant-and-go mentality. Gets too cute in the hole at times. Lacks explosiveness and speed to the corner. Average access to burst after a cut. No home-run speed in open field. Doesn't separate from linebackers on wheel routes. Chip blocks lack commitment. Ball security appears to be an issue. 
His cuts have bounce, but not organic explosion…relies more on timing-pacing than burst to shake defenders…prefers to sidestep contact rather thanpower through it…runs tough, but more finesse than expected…late to get north-south on outside runs…ball security was an issue with nine fumbles on only 308offensive touches (fumbled once every 34.2 touches)…offers blocking upside, but needs to improve his awareness and urgency in pass protection…only one season asthe full-time back.
One-year starter ; Good speed, but not elite ; Will need development in blitz protection ;Summary:  The night after the running back prospects worked out at the NFL Scouting Combine, WalterFootball.com caught up with two running back coaches, one from an AFC playoff team and one from a NFC playoff team. Independently, they both named the same three running backs as players who impressed them during the field workout. They were Ohio State’s Mike Weber, Penn State’s Miles Sanders and Michigan State’s L.J. Scott. ;Sanders had a very fast 40 time of 4.49 seconds at the combine. The coaches also liked how he looked in the field work. Sanders showed athleticism and quick feet with cutting ability beyond his fast 40 time. After serving as the backup to Saquon Barkley early in his career, in his senior year, Sanders averaged 5.8 yards per carry for 1,274 yards with nine touchdowns. ;Sanders has three-down starting potential for the NFL. What really stands out about and makes him unique is what an excellent job he does of keeping his legs going after contact. Sanders uses that to break tackles and accelerate downfield when it looks like he is going to be stopped. He is also tough to tackle at the second level as he runs through contact. Sanders’ knee bend and leverage allow him to run behind his pads and power through arm tackles. On top of his excellent feet, Sanders has some elusiveness in the open field as he can cut to weave his way around defenders. Sanders has a good jump cut and lateral quickness to dodge would-be tacklers.",gliderinstincts instinctsfootwork footworkagility agilityshake shaketacklers tacklersframe framepad padlevel levelfinish

Damien Harris,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/damien-harris/32004841-5231-1469-57ad-03c4e9f5e495,"Disciplined and rugged with a very strong sense of who he is as a running back. He operates with a good feel for blocking schemes and finds the designed yards while adding extra with his power and some elusiveness. He lacks game-breaking juice as a runner and will need to keep his weight down or he'll end up in the ""grinder"" category of runners. Harris is more likely to be good than great as a pro, but his size, every-down game and ball security give him a chance to have fruitful career as a solid starter.

Although he benefited from a strong offensive line and deep backfield, which allowed him to stay fresh late in games, Harris consistentlygained more yards than what was blocked for him due to his vision, competitive edge and ability to shift his weight to elude defenders. He had more pass blockingreps than the average college back and made it his personal mission to bury defenders with his tenacity and awareness.

Lack of speed ; Can be caught from behind ; Not a fast back ;Summary:  Alabama has been churning out a steady stream of NFL running backs under Nick Saban, and Harris will keep that tradition alive along with Crimson Tide teammate Josh Jacobs. Harris was the starter over Jacobs, but Jacobs will be drafted ahead of Harris in 2019. Still, over the past three seasons, Harris was a steady contributor for Alabama. ;On only 145 carries in 2016, Harris averaged 7.2 yards per carry for 1,040 yards with two touchdowns. He had 14 receptions for 99 yards, too. Harris was Alabama’s leading rusher for the season. Harris then ran really well for the Crimson Tide in 2017, averaging 7.4 yards per carry for 1,000 yards with 11 touchdowns. He also had 12 receptions for 91 yards. As a senior, Harris averaged 5.8 yards per carry in 2018 for 876 yards and nine touchdowns. He also had 22 receptions for 204 yards. ;For the NFL, Harris could be a three-down starter who is the engine of a steady rushing attack. He has good bulk along with knee bend and ability to run behind his yards. That combination makes him tough to tackle and leads to him picking up yards after contact. Harris would be an excellent fit in a zone-blocking system because he thrives as a one-cut downhill runner. He also has good vision, cutting ability, and decisive running to hit the hole. On top of handling a larger work load, Harris does well in short-yardage situations. ;What makes Harris more of a second-day talent than a first-rounder is a lack of speed. He is quicker than fast. He has the speed to hit the hole and accelerate to the second level, but he can be caught from behind on long carries, and that will be seen even more in the NFL given the faster defenders. For the pro game, Harris is not a back who is a home run hitter with elite speed.",ALABAMA,88,RB,New England Patriots,2019,"Disciplined and rugged with a very strong sense of who he is as a running back.

Darrell Henderson,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darrell-henderson/32004845-4e05-4456-6f99-3e76d883b110,"He checks in slightly undersized, doesn't have great vision and runs with a narrow base that makes him easier to tackle, but so far, those concerns haven't slowed him one bit. Big-play production is impossible to ignore, but his running style makes him best-suited to a complementary slasher role in a spread-based attack. In basketball, Henderson would be the explosive sixth man with the ability to swing certain games in your favor if he catches fire. On the ground or out of the backfield, Henderson can catch fire.
 three-year starter at Memphis, Henderson was the lead back in the Tigers’ run-oriented zone scheme, benefiting from a rotation that helped keep himfresh and sizable holes on tape. He leaves Memphis No. 2 in most rushing categories (behind DeAngelo Williams), including career rushing yards (3,545) and rushingscores (36). Similar to Dalvin Cook, Henderson is at his best when he can slash and weave through gaps, using his open-field moves to make defenders look silly at thesecond level. He isn’t much of a grinder inside and likely won’t be the same type of home-run hitter at the next level due to average long speed. Overall, Hendersonfaces a significant jump in difficulty level going from AAC defenses to the NFL, but his combination of balance, agility and run instincts helps him gravitate towardspace, projecting best in a zone-heavy scheme.","Home-run hitter doesn't begin to describe his explosive production. Averaged 8.9 yards per carry over last 344 attempts. Movement has electric feel to it. Quick acceleration turns to get-away long speed. 43 carries of 15-plus yards and 11 total touchdowns of 54-plus in 2018 alone. Unusual contact balance for narrow-base runner. Keeps feet moving at all times. Hits and spins out of contact. More physical than expected as run finisher. Used on drop-offs and screens out of backfield. Maintains potency as a pass catcher. Shows ability to track and adjust down the field.

Upright running style with narrow base. Needs to get better at slipping solid contact. Displays some hip tightness and is a one-track runner. Plays too fast to effectively stack moves. High center of gravity forces turn rather than cuts. Faced light numbers in the box. Touchdown runs happening in wide-open spaces. Sees what is there rather than what is developing. May not offer pass protection value on third down.

Dexter Williams,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dexter-williams/32005749-4c03-6343-3624-9a83687bd3f7,"Ascending every-down running back prospect who showed major flashes of becoming an NFL starter in his most active season to date. Williams runs with a good combination of feel, force and juice, which allows for a variety of methods in creating yards for himself. His evaluation could require additional character work and his relative lack of experience could mean a slower integration into an NFL offense; however, he offers exciting upside with the talent to become a productive, NFL starter.
A one-year starter at Notre Dame, Williams spent his first three seasons in South Bend as a backup who was in and out of the medical tent and coach’sdoghouse. He took advantage of his second and third chances and developed a more professional attitude for his breakout senior season, ranking top-15 nationally inrushing yards per game (110.6) in 2018. Williams looks his best downhill where he can attack lanes and allow his athleticism to take over. He is still in thedevelopment phase as a pass catcher and blocker, but shows noticeable upside in both areas. Overall, Williams hasn’t been the model of reliability over his career,but his turnaround and productive senior season give evaluators optimism because he has the natural talent to upgrade a team’s running back depth chart if hestays committed.","Possesses adequate NFL size with good flexibility. Stepped into bell-cow role with ease. Had four games with 140-plus yards and averaged a touchdown run every 12 carries. Understands block development and where lanes will originate. Adequate decisiveness as interior runner. Presses line of scrimmage to set blockers up for success. Loose hips to flow where his eyes take him. Processes traffic quickly to work away from peek-a-boo gap-fitters. Impressive acceleration. Mashes gas to win foot races to corner or hit the home run. Runs with square pads and drops heavy, pre-emptive blows on tacklers. Small career workload for fresh NFL legs. Ball security has been excellent in relatively limited work.

Outstanding footwork, hips and lateral agility to patch moves together…burst to shake pursuit when he bounces runs outside…balance to manipulatedefenders in space…sustains his speed to run away from chasers…trusts his vision to take him from daylight to pay dirt…recorded eight rushes of 30-plus yards (sevenresulted in touchdowns) in 2018, including a 97-yarder (second-longest in ND history)…fumbled only twice in college (both in 2018)…graduated with his degree(December 2018)…plenty of tread still on his tires (279 touches the last four seasons)…added 10 pounds prior to his breakout 2018 season.","Small sample size with limited tape against quality competition. Never more than 39 carries in a single season before 2018. Has an arrest (2016) and four-game suspension (2018) in his background. Slew-footed running style can affect balance through cuts. Needs to step in and square blitzers rather than defaulting to body rolls. Easier to upend in space because of narrow running base. Vision goes from good to average after he's past the line of scrimmage. Average elusiveness in open field.

Bryce Love,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bryce-love/32004c4f-5604-4766-ac8b-19be320b56b7,"Frenetic runner with explosive engine that was grounded in 2018 due to lingering injury and substandard run-blocking. Love lacks the desired size of a volume runner, but his sudden burst and top-end speed offer home-run potential that is unlikely to be ignored by teams looking to add a big-play option into their offense. Love could find his calling in a time-share situation, but his ceiling as a pro might rest on his ability to run with decisiveness and threaten as a pass-catcher..","Character considered an A+ by scouts. Highly intelligent and quick to process new information. Willing to play through pain. Keeps feet moving through his reads. Quick, controlled steps provide balance and on-demand acceleration. Wins foot races around the corner against linebackers. Burst and top-end speed to turn 16 yards into 60. Runs feet through contact as interior runner. Able to get skinny and squeeze through tight creases. Slides and pivots around big bodies littering his path. Rare ability to stay square in his lateral movements away from tacklers. Better pass-catching option than numbers would indicate.

Excessive stutter-and-gather in his downhill approach. Running style is more frantic than fluid. Will need to run with better trust and anticipation as a pro.

Devin Singletary,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/devin-singletary/32005349-4e18-6919-d1e6-003f4632ba87,"Undersized, three-down back with rare improvisational skill and toughness through contact to squeeze every yard he can from each carry. Singletary was asked to catch it less in 2018, but he's a tough cover out of the backfield and has the dog in him to step up and deliver a lick in blitz pickup. He ran poorly and did not test well in short-area quickness events at the combine, which could hurt his draft standing, but might not deter him from NFL success as a complementary runner.
A two-year starter at Florida Atlantic, Singletary produced from the moment he stepped foot onto campus in Boca Raton, rewriting the Owls rushingrecords. His 54 rushing touchdowns the last two seasons was easily the best in college football over that span. Singletary runs with remarkable balance to elude intight quarters, leading the FBS with 69.8 percent of his rushing yards in 2018 coming after initial contact. He is tougher than he looks, but his lack of body armor andquestions about being a three-down player will be the main concerns for his next-level transition. Overall, Singletary is uniquely skilled at forcing missed tackles dueto his lateral agility and ability to feel openings, projecting as a LeSean McCoy type of offensive weapon in the NFL.","High-end production seems to follow him. Touchdown monster with vision and power near goal line. Quick to process and respond to oncoming traffic. First responder rarely gets him down. Twitchy footwork for instant stop-starts. Limber for long, lateral jump-cuts. Instant acceleration after short-area cuts to avoid tacklers. Shrinks to sneak in and out of creases between the tackles. Access to steep, backside cuts. Eludes lurking angle tackles with plus peripheral vision. Good feel for bold cuts versus subtle ones in open field. Willful, determined demeanor of a much bigger back. Rare ability to absorb powerful shots and balance through contact. Runs frequently end with him still on his feet. Creates through power and shake to maximize each carry. Route separation to threaten out of backfield. Courageous pass protection with a highlight reel full of greatest hits. 
Terrific lateral agility that gives defenders nightmares…sets up moves with widescreen vision and slippery athleticism (led the FBS with 113 brokentackles in 2018, 25 more than any other player)…outstanding instincts to sense developing lanes and dart between open spaces…patient ball carrier and won’t forcethings…natural balance with the core strength to keep his feet…not overpowering, but runs low and doesn’t gear down at contact, finishing strong…impressive 191.3fumble rate (four career fumbles)…nice job on angle routes and catches passes thrown at him…nose for the end zone, ranking sixth all time in FBS history with 66rushing touchdowns (five players ahead of him all played four years)…above-average production with three straight 1,000-yard rushing seasons, setting the schoolrecords for career rushing yards and all-purpose yards.","Volume runner in a change-of-pace body. Has close to 600 contact-filled touches over last two seasons. Lacks top-end speed to run away from opponents in space. Play speed tends to be monotone throughout the rep. Rarely keeps runs play-side and looks for early cuts. Excessive cuts will be met with earlier tackles from swarming, NFL defenders. Will need to learn to run a more disciplined track. Tendency is to bounce it to his left. Power diminishes when facing squared contact. Suffered from focus drops this season. 
Lacks an ideal build for the position with limited growth potential…average power as an inside runner…tends to fatigue over four quarters andworkload will be a question mark with his size…lacks ideal long-speed for the position…wasn’t asked to stay home and pass protect in college…receiving productiondeclined over his career.",FLORIDA ATLANTIC,75,RB,Buffalo Bills,2019,"Undersized, three-down back with rare improvisational skill and toughness through contact to squeeze every yard he can from each carry.

Terrific lateral agility that gives defenders nightmares…sets up moves with widescreen vision and slippery athleticism (led the FBS with 113 brokentackles in 2018, 25 more than any other player)…outstanding instincts to sense developing lanes and dart between open spaces…patient ball carrier and won’t forcethings…natural balance with the core strength to keep his feet…not overpowering, but runs low and doesn’t gear down at contact, finishing strong…impressive 191.3fumble rate (four career fumbles)…nice job on angle routes and catches passes thrown at him…nose for the end zone, ranking sixth all time in FBS history with 66rushing touchdowns (five players ahead of him all played four years)…above-average production with three straight 1,000-yard rushing seasons, setting the schoolrecords for career rushing yards and all-purpose yards. Volume runner in a change-of-pace body. Has close to 600 contact-filled touches over last two seasons. Lacks top-end speed to run away from opponents in space. Play speed tends to be monotone throughout the rep. Rarely keeps runs play-side and looks for early cuts. Excessive cuts will be met with earlier tackles from swarming, NFL defenders. Will need to learn to run a more disciplined track. Tendency is to bounce it to his left. Power diminishes when facing squared contact. Suffered from focus drops this season. 
Lacks an ideal build for the position with limited growth potential…average power as an inside runner…tends to fatigue over four quarters andworkload will be a question mark with his size…lacks ideal long-speed for the position…wasn’t asked to stay home and pass protect in college…receiving productiondeclined over his career.",undersizedback backrare rareimprovisational improvisationalskill

Trayveon Williams,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trayveon-williams/32005749-4c18-5325-3179-dd521a18c706,"Productive runner who added weight and stepped into an every-down role and became one of the big SEC surprises in his first season in Jimbo Fisher's offense. Williams isn't overly dynamic by NFL standards, but he's a calm runner who stacks moves and eludes defenders to post his fair share of chunk runs. He's tough but undersized and might get pigeon-holed as a committee back with above-average third-down value thanks to his tenacity as a pass-blocker.
A two-year starter at Texas A&M, Williams made an immediate impact as a true freshman and despite a down sophomore year, he thrived in 2018 underthe new coaching staff and the Aggies’ zone-blocking scheme. He finished third in the FBS in rushing yards as a junior and leaves College Station No. 3 on the school’sall-time rushing list. Williams looks like a pinball between the tackles with his gliding cuts and run balance to bounce off contact (similar to Ameer Abdullah atNebraska). He is active in the screen game and does a nice job finding his blockers to maximize runs. Overall, Williams doesn’t have ideal size or strength for theposition, but he is quick out of the blocks with the vision and competitive run style to pick, slide and weave through enemy territory.","Football character flies off-the-charts. Outspoken alpha who set the tone for the team. Raved about inside the program. Added weight in 2018 off-season to shoulder heavy workload. Coaches say he got stronger physically and mentally as season wore on. Transitioned effectively into pro-style rushing attack. Calm runner who stays in his shoes. Good stutter-go to freeze tackler and open perimeter. Tacklers had a hard time finishing him in space. Changes direction of the run without gearing down. Handled every-down duties and is a fighter in pass protection. Proved to be reliable pass catcher no matter the route.
Explosive athlete in space…hits his top speed quickly and sustains his pace to take it the distance (10 plays of 30-plus yards in 2018)…lateral agility to cutback against the defense…doesn’t have directional habits and keeps defenders guessing…shows the patience to pick his spots at the line of scrimmage…balance tospin off contact or step out of low tackle attempts (1,024 yards after initial contact in 2018)…runs bigger than his size and difficult to get on the ground…dangerous inthe screen game…two-year captain and called a “team-first player” by his coaches…highly productive 2018 season, setting Texas A&M records for single-seasonrushing yards (1,760) and all-purpose yards (2,038)…five 200-plus yard rushing games (school record), including three in 2018.","Looks small at times on tape. Has a tendency to play at one speed. Average creativity as a runner. Can do a better job of pressing the line to set-up blocks. Would benefit from more fastball in his burst. Will need to better decisiveness as NFL runner. Struggles with sudden elusive movements when he elevates speed. Needs to see and plan his cuts in advance. Doesn't run with NFL-caliber power to stride and drive forward.
Undersized frame with limited growth potential…runs tough and low to the ground, but won’t consistently create through power…doesn’t have therun strength to be a pile pusher…more reactive as a runner than anticipatory…makes too much contact with his own blockers inside…room to improve his ballsecurity (six career fumbles)…drops his shoulder in pass protection, but doesn’t have the body to consistently face-up rushers…battled a left ankle injury (September2017) for much of his sophomore season.",TEXAS A&M,169,RB,Cincinnati Bengals,2019,"Productive runner who added weight and stepped into an every-down role and became one of the big SEC surprises in his first season in Jimbo Fisher's offense.

Myles Gaskin,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/myles-gaskin/32004741-5321-1909-2ae0-a123794bf24d,"Durable, productive runner who could find the transition from college to pro more challenging due to his lack of size. Gaskin's quick feet and loose hips offer early elusiveness and success on wide flowing plays, but his overall play is less explosive/elusive than his athletic traits might suggest. He will need to run with better decisiveness and downhill burst to become an effective member of a running back committee, but his ability to play on third downs should help his chances for some early touches.","Longer torso with shorter legs provides optimal center of gravity. Despite a lack of desired size, has been able to take a heavier workload. Adequate lower body looseness to side-step early penetration into backfield. 
Light in his strides with ability to make quick cuts on outside zone runs. Able to string his jump-cuts together early in the run when probing for his lane. Adequate burst to the perimeter in a foot race to turn the corner. Early access to his top gear. Extremely consistent and productive throughout his four years at Washington. Shows the courage to square up and take on much bigger pass rushers in pass protection. Capable pass-catcher with sharpened focus and ball skills when targeted downfield.","Smaller frame than desired for an early down, NFL running back. Oftentimes looks for something better than the designed rush lane rather than trusting the path. Has moments of hesitation when attempting to make his reads downhill. Might not have a natural feel for run-lane development. Inconsistent as interior runner; needs to play with better downhill burst through the line. Creativity falls flat when attempting to elude second-level tacklers. Anticipates contact and will slow his feet rather than accelerate through it. Lack of size and consistent contact aggression could limit yards after contact in pros.",WASHINGTON,212,RB,Miami Dolphins,2019,"Durable, productive runner who could find the transition from college to pro more challenging due to his lack of size. Gaskin's quick feet and loose hips offer early elusiveness and success on wide flowing plays, but his overall play is less explosive/elusive than his athletic traits might suggest. He will need to run with better decisiveness and downhill burst to become an effective member of a running back committee, but his ability to play on third downs should help his chances for some early touches. Longer torso with shorter legs provides optimal center of gravity. Despite a lack of desired size, has been able to take a heavier workload. Adequate lower body looseness to side-step early penetration into backfield. 
Light in his strides with ability to make quick cuts on outside zone runs. Able to string his jump-cuts together early in the run when probing for his lane. Adequate burst to the perimeter in a foot race to turn the corner. Early access to his top gear. Extremely consistent and productive throughout his four years at Washington. Shows the courage to square up and take on much bigger pass rushers in pass protection. Capable pass-catcher with sharpened focus and ball skills when targeted downfield. Smaller frame than desired for an early down, NFL running back. Oftentimes looks for something better than the designed rush lane rather than trusting the path. Has moments of hesitation when attempting to make his reads downhill. Might not have a natural feel for run-lane development. Inconsistent as interior runner; needs to play with better downhill burst through the line. Creativity falls flat when attempting to elude second-level tacklers.

He runs tough along the interior and has the vision and agility to slip tackles, but his lack of size and explosive top-end play speed could work against him. Hill might not have the skills needed to handle third-down duties, so he could be pigeon-holed as a try-hard backup with average upside.
A three-year starter at Oklahoma State, Hill quickly made an impact in Stillwater and led the Cowboys in rushing each of his three seasons. After leadingthe Big 12 in rushing (by a sizable margin) as a sophomore, he shared more of the workload as a junior (three OSU players had 120-plus carries), finishing just shy of1,000 yards. Hill is a fun ball carrier to study because he is a chunk play waiting to happen with his lateral agility and quick-thinking rush attack (41 plays of 20-plusyards in college). However, he runs slanted and tends to be overly impulsive, sensing run lanes, but inconsistent timing hurts his batting average. Overall, Hill hasquestionable three-down ability in the NFL, but he is a shifty, balanced runner who is tough to tackle one-on-one, projecting as a complementary weapon.","Consistent play and production in all three seasons. Feet have good life and runs with a wide base. Willing to keep runs play-side in search of daylight. Limber hips to balance and recover against contact. Fast decision-maker on the move. Able to slam on brakes for sudden cuts from a full sprint. Shifty in the open field. Tight, rapid spin move to rid himself of a tackle. Runs like his hair is on fire and fights hard against the tackle. Has access to sharp, lateral cuts to bounce the run wide. Outstanding ball security with just five career fumbles.
Outstanding short-area burst to laterally plant and juke…springy lower body and makes tackle attempts more difficult…quickly collects his feet toredirect and accelerate through holes…runs with a natural feel and timing for cutback lanes, sensing holes before they expand…shows the initial speed to outleverage the defender on the perimeter…uses a stiff-arm to extend outside runs…competitive with the ball in his hands and doesn’t waste time dancing…decentreceiving production in college (49/304/1)…five career fumbles, but none in 2018…one of only six players in school history to reach 3,500 career rushing yards.","Undersized by NFL standards. Running style is frenetic and lacking tempo. Tends to crowd the running lane unnecessarily. Will careen off of his own blockers in the middle of his run. Doesn't elude punishing blows in open field. Some wasted motion open-field movements and jukes. Paces too quickly and fails to run tacklers into blockers. Top-end speed appears marginal. Linebackers can cut off his angle to the corner. Just five carries of 30+ yards in 2018. Gets steamrolled by size in pass protection.

He has enough talent to handle the packaged/gadget plays, but with kick-return value diminishing league-wide, he will need additional fundamentals training at one position to be more than a shiny toy that is rarely out of the box.","Proven playmaker with NFL size. Averaged a touchdown every 13.5 touches and 9.2 yards per touch. Finished three-year run with seven kick return scores. Subtle shifts without breaking stride and runs through arm tackles. Used in joker role but has one-cut potential as runner. Adequate vision and cuts effectively off blocks. Not overly shifty, but creates some misses. Balances through heavy contact for YAC yards. Works into traffic as pass-catcher. Above-average catch-and-run option. Provides valuable roster flexibility. ","Takes time to gather weight and cut. Can be impatient with the ball in his hands. Improv-oriented and gets off rush track as running back. Below-average short-area route quickness. Needs to be more sudden to uncover against tight man. Needs more bend and upfield burst into routes.

D'Andre Swift,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/d-andre-swift/32005357-4922-8476-53db-e64aaf6e01f5,"Swift possesses the play traits and running style of a skillful NFL veteran and is the latest in an avalanche of talented Georgia backs. Tempo and decisiveness are his calling cards, making him a highly talented inside/outside zone runner. He's a cerebral runner who understands block timing and uses quick-cut agility and rare spatial awareness to read and react to defenses beyond the second level. Swift isn't overly explosive as a home-run hitter and doesn't run with the violence of last year's top running back, Josh Jacobs. He can step right in and provide early stability and production as an efficient, every-down back with Offensive Rookie of the Year potential.
 A two-year starter at Georgia, Swift was the feature back in former offensive coordinator James Coley’s pro-style spread. He played a key role in three straight SEC Eastern Division titles for the Bulldogs and finished his career No. 1 in school history with 6.56 yards per carry, just ahead of Todd Gurley's 6.44. Swift is a patient athlete with the short-area explosiveness and speed to pick, slide and juke, making him tough to tackle one-on-one. He needs to clean up some inconsistencies in passing situations, but defenders lose him as a receiver and effort isn’t a concern in pass protection. Overall, Swift has the uncanny ability to make defenders miss and runs with the instinctive ability to quickly survey and create positive yardage, projecting as a feature back in the NFL if he stays healthy. ","Compact build with strong lower body and three-down talent. Understands blocking schemes and trusts his big guys up front. Reads overflowing linebackers on zone carries making early run-lane adjustments. Rare feel and vision in tight quarters as interior runner. Listens to fluidity of the crease and takes what it gives him. Effective jump-cut allows him to press runs deep into the hole. Tremendous feel for spatial relationship. Maintains balance through twists, turns and contact. Gets right on top of tacklers before cutting. Quick to find acceleration after slowing his feet. Can run expanded route tree and separate out of breaks. Hands are soft and sticky as pass-catcher. Willing to step into pass protection duties and has some dog in him.

Quicker than fast, lacking home-run burst. Get-away burst to the outside is just average. Doesn't move piles or finish with plus authority. Ends up working harder than other backs to find explosive runs. Will need to learn to use his hands in pass protection. Doesn't always trust the vision as a short-yardage back.

Jonathan Taylor,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jonathan-taylor/32005441-5943-1618-c081-5dd6b2d0b829,"Supremely productive, well-built runner with an all-day, every-day mentality that helped lead him to three Big Ten rushing titles. Taylor runs with bend and burst as an outside runner and has home-run speed once he gets into the open field. He displays an ability to weave around interior traffic but might have evolved into more of a thinker than reactor inside due to fumbling issues and the litany of loaded fronts he faced. His patience and understanding of the where/when of blocks allowed him to thrive in multiple run schemes. He's more body puncher than knockout artist, wearing down his opponents with carry after carry. His traits, toughness and talent should make him an early starter with a solid ceiling and more third-down potential than we saw at Wisconsin.
A three-year starter at Wisconsin, Taylor was the lead back in head coach Paul Chryst’s pro-style scheme. He is one of the most productive runners in college football history, breaking Herschel Walker’s record (by 578 yards) for the most rushing yards by a player through his junior season, finishing his career sixth on the FBS all-time rushing list. More than simply a north-south runner, Taylor understands where and when to hit the hole while also keeping his options open, smoothly redirecting and making it tough on defenders to square him up for the tackle. His horrendous fumble rate (one every 52.9 offensive touches) and lack of pass pro reps are concerns, although he saw an uptick in targets as a pass catcher in 2019 and handled it well. Overall, Taylor needs to eliminate the fumbles and improve his reliability on passing downs, but his balanced, instinctive run qualities and controlled movements project him as a featured NFL starter.","Prototypical height, weight, speed and durability. Hit 200-plus yards 12 times during career. Rarely rushes the run and allows lead blocks to eat. Deep line of scrimmage press for cutback freedom. Sinks, plants and cuts with one-cut talent. Navigates and flows with contours of the run lane. Burst around the corner outpaces pursuit. Former track man with a breakaway gear. Plays with good bend and forward lean. Balances through contact for additional yardage. Possesses talent to make something out of nothing. Chops out legs from under blitzers. Showed some route-running ability against Northwestern.
 Runs with outstanding balance and forward lean…skilled vision and patience at the line of scrimmage…gravitates towards developing holes…flexible body type, sticking his foot in the ground, dropping his hips and changing course…never gives up at contact and crawls for extra yards…runs through arm tackles, spinning off defenders…outstanding perimeter and second-level speed to force poor angles…shows a home run gear in the open field (10 plays of 35-plus yards in 2019)…well built for the position and physically durable (40 straight starts)…solid hands as a screen target, handling the added usage as a receiver in 2019…described as a “culture setter” by his coaches due to his maturity and intelligence…elite production as the only player in FBS history to rush for 1,900-plus yards in three straight seasons, needing only 736 carries to reach 5,000 yards (fewest in FBS history)…finished in the top 10 in Heisman Trophy voting all three seasons and became the third repeat winner of the Doak Walker Award (Ricky Williams and Darren McFadden). 
Power runner ; Strength to run through tackles ; Tremendous stiff arm ; Contact balance ; Gets yards after contact ; Strong lower body ; Short-yardage asset ; Keeps feet going after contact ; Can move the pile ; Good speed ; Acceleration ; Quick first-step to hit the hole ; Second gear in the open field ; Can rip off long gains on any carry ; Instinctive runner ; Excellent vision ; Superb patience ; Can create for himself ; Anticipation ; Cutting ability ; Quick feet ; Receiving ability ; Quality route-runner ; Good enough hands ; Excellent body lean to run low ; Runs behind pads ; Bends at the knee ; Decisive runner ; Three-down-starter ability","Tallied over 300 touches in all three years. Wear and tear could be a concern for NFL teams. Fumbled 15 times over three years. Occasional hesitation processing interior. Lacks fluid jump-cuts. Slows feet and covers into contact inside at times. Anticipates second-level moves instead of splitting defenders. Not a powerful pile mover in tight quarters. Limited catch total with elevated drop total. Play lacked confidence and energy against Ohio State in-season. 
His lateral quickness is efficient, but not sudden…his tape showed a lot of defined holes and wasn’t asked to consistently create, benefiting from a mauling offensive line…work in progress as a receiver…late adjusting to throws and will have his share of drops (four in 2019)…fumbling and ball security were a consistent issue over his career, putting the ball on the ground 18 times, including six fumbles in 2019…pass protection is more of an unknown variable because he wasn’t asked to do it very much…enters the NFL with almost 1,000 touches in college. 
Will need development in blitz protection ;Summary:  Going to back to Barry Alvarez’s time at Wisconsin, the Badgers have consistently fielded a tremendous rushing attack and are known for their talented tailbacks and tough offensive linemen. Taylor will keep the tradition going in the 2020 NFL Draft after dominating college football over the past three seasons. ;Taylor was superb out the gate averaging in 2017, 6.6 yards per carry for 1,977 yards with 13 touchdowns. As a sophomore, Taylor averaged 7.1 yards per carry for 2,194 yards with 16 touchdowns. He had eight receptions for 60 yards as well. Taylor exceeded 2,000 yards again in 2019, collecting 2,003 yards and 21 touchdowns while averaging 6.3 yards per carry. The junior also showed more receiving ability with 26 receptions for 252 yards and five touchdowns through the air. ;There is no doubt Taylor has the ability to make an impact as a running back in the NFL given his skill set to be a three-down starter. He possesses an excellent combination of size and speed that lets him run over tacklers or by them. Taylor has a strong build and is very difficult to get down, as he will power through tackles and bounce off defenders to continue to gain yards. He has superb contact balance and runs behind his pads with good knee bend. In short-yardage situations, Taylor is an asset who can create on his own with his power to push the pile. He keeps his legs going after contact with a powerful lower body that is tough to stop. An added element to his power is a wicked stiff-arm that makes it tough for defenders to grab him. ;Taylor can rip off yards in chunks in the open field, making him a threat to turn ordinary carries into big gains with his speed to get downfield. Taylor has a quick first-step and a second gear that allows him to run away from defenders. Taylor isn’t Chris Johnson fast, but he has good speed for the position. With his cutting ability and quick feet, Taylor has some elusiveness in the open field as well. ;Aside from his size and speed, Taylor is a natural runner with very good instincts. He displays excellent vision, patience and anticipation to follow his offensive line before bursting downhill. When holes aren’t open, Taylor is patient to let his line create a crease and uses his vision very well to make something out of nothing. Taylor anticipates where a hole is about to open, and that lets him get to the second level consistently. ;In the passing game, Taylor has pretty good hands for a power back. He can makes some difficult catches and is dangerous in space. In time, he should be an asset in pass protection, but like all college backs, he will need coaching and development for pass blocking in the NFL.",WISCONSIN,41,RB,Indianapolis Colts,2020,"Supremely productive, well-built runner with an all-day, every-day mentality that helped lead him to three Big Ten rushing titles.

Cam Akers,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cam-akers/3200414b-4541-5291-73e4-84e805a9ffce,"Despite a disappointing win-loss record and a lack of blocking up front, Akers maintained a consistent level of play that represents his football character. He runs with tempo and flow but alters his rush track at a moment's notice when needed. He is elusive but lacking the instant burst of a slasher capable of stacking long runs in a single game. Akers has above-average open-field vision once he's into the second level and looks to run through the tackler's pads as a finisher. He's a three-down option with good feel for finding the crease near the goal line, but ball security needs to improve. He can be Leg 1 or 2 of a tandem rushing attack and is one of the more natural runners in the draft.
 A three-year starter at Florida State, Akers was the feature back in former offensive coordinator Kendal Briles’ spread, up-tempo offense. Despite belowaverage offensive line and quarterback play the last three seasons, he joined Warrick Dunn and Dalvin Cook as just the third player in school history with multiple 1,000-yard rushing seasons. One of the most talented players any time he takes the field, Akers is a sudden runner with explosive lateral moves (his best trait) to cut away from defenders, forcing overpursuit. However, he is too much of a checkers (aggressive, spontaneous) runner with his attacking mindset and needs to introduce more chess (patient, strategic) to his run style. Overall, Akers would be a higher ranked prospect with better vision or run compass, but he is a physically impressive athlete with the shifty moves and toughness to create yardage, projecting as a souped-up version of Duke Johnson in the NFL.","Compact, rocked-up build with powerful legs. Played behind subpar run blocking and often found his own production. Tough finisher who's able to shred arm tackles and balance through contact. Wicked open-field spin move to slip defender. Instinctive runner with good feel for run-lane development. Multiple cuts and run-lane resets without losing momentum. Eyes and feet work in unison. Former high school quarterback with trick play potential. Sudden feet to elude sudden traffic. Nose for the end zone once he's in range. Open-field vision boosts screen-game value. Has grit needed to handle pass-blocking duties.
Dynamic athlete with elusive feet…his ankle-breaking lateral cuts make defenders look like they’re playing on ice…forces missed tackles with his instinctive open-field quickness…elastic body type with fluid torso flexibility…squares his shoulders, drops his pads and barrels forward to finish runs…clears holes with immediate acceleration when the blocking is defined and the runway is offered…runs with noticeable confidence and poise…doesn’t break stride at the catch point…experienced running the wildcat (5-for-8, 97 yards passing)…mature work ethic and commits himself in the weight room…played through an ankle sprain in 2018…great teammate and humble competitor, battling through an inefficient offense much of his time at FSU though he still led the team in rushing each of his three seasons.

May have been conditioned to look for early escapes due to blocking. Productive out of backfield but hands aren't that natural. Has trouble adjusting to throws outside the frame. 
Spotty vision and doesn’t have a great feel as an inside runner…needs to introduce more patience at the line of scrimmage, making too much contact with his own blockers…late to anticipate developing holes, slamming the gas instead of giving his blockers more time…average-sized frame for NFL work…inconsistent hands away from his body with six drops in 2019…poor technique and anchor in pass protection, attempting to catch rushers…ball security needs improved with 10 career fumbles.
Selective as a blocker ; Blocks soft at times ;Summary:  Florida State has had an excellent run of producing NFL running backs in recent years, and Akers will continue the tradition established by Devonta Freeman and Dalvin Cook.

Clyde Edwards-Helaire,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/clyde-edwards-helaire/32004544-5781-5562-8963-df06e680f700,"Compact, sudden back who runs low to the ground with power and balance to break tackles and the agility to bob, weave and shake them in tight quarters. Edwards-Helaire runs with instinctive eyes and quick-cut foot speed. He doesn't really have tells or tendencies and can alter the rush track when needed, which makes him so unpredictable for defenses. While he can create for himself, he's better off working inside-out as NFL linebackers might be able to outflank him on pure outside runs. He has pop behind his pads but lacks short-yardage size. He has the talent to become a good, three-down back in time, but needs to improve in pass protection.
 A one-year starter at LSU, Edwards-Helaire was the feature back in offensive coordinator Steve Ensminger’s offense, performing his best in the biggest games – of his seven 100-yard rushing games in 2019, four were vs. top-10 ranked teams (Florida, Auburn, Alabama and Clemson). Among players with at least 210 carries in 2019, he ranked third in the FBS (behind J.K. Dobbins and Malcolm Perry) with 6.58 yards per rush and was a master at the hidden yards, turning 4-yard runs into 7-yard gains. While he is quicker than fast, Edwards-Helaire always has an escape plan with his elusive quickness, determined vision and low center of gravity to break tackles. With his high-level ball skills, he is dynamic in the passing game and shows the ability to shake defenders mid-route or hide behind blockers in the screen game. Overall, Edwards-Helaire needs technique work in pass protection, but he is productive with the ball in his hands due to his blend of agility, power and toughness, projecting as an any-down player who can line up across the formation. ","Ball security is outstanding. Runs low to the ground with superb bend and balance. 36 percent of his carries were for first downs or touchdowns in 2019. Can cut-and-go without stopping anywhere on field. Quick gather and cut agility laterally or on downhill flow. Has spin move, elongated jump cut, and sudden double cut in his bag. Makes tacklers miss in a phone booth. Instinctive eyes and feet make him unpredictable. Alters run tempo at times to con flowing linebackers. Squares pads and falls forward to finish.

","Quick but doesn't have speed to house longer runs. RPOs made linebackers more tentative early in run. Smaller back as interior runner. Average power near goal line or on short yardage.

",LSU,32,RB,Kansas City Chiefs,2020,"Compact, sudden back who runs low to the ground with power and balance to break tackles and the agility to bob, weave and shake them in tight quarters. Edwards-Helaire runs with instinctive eyes and quick-cut foot speed. He doesn't really have tells or tendencies and can alter the rush track when needed, which makes him so unpredictable for defenses. While he can create for himself, he's better off working inside-out as NFL linebackers might be able to outflank him on pure outside runs. He has pop behind his pads but lacks short-yardage size. He has the talent to become a good, three-down back in time, but needs to improve in pass protection.
 A one-year starter at LSU, Edwards-Helaire was the feature back in offensive coordinator Steve Ensminger’s offense, performing his best in the biggest games – of his seven 100-yard rushing games in 2019, four were vs. top-10 ranked teams (Florida, Auburn, Alabama and Clemson). Among players with at least 210 carries in 2019, he ranked third in the FBS (behind J.K. Dobbins and Malcolm Perry) with 6.58 yards per rush and was a master at the hidden yards, turning 4-yard runs into 7-yard gains. While he is quicker than fast, Edwards-Helaire always has an escape plan with his elusive quickness, determined vision and low center of gravity to break tackles. With his high-level ball skills, he is dynamic in the passing game and shows the ability to shake defenders mid-route or hide behind blockers in the screen game. Overall, Edwards-Helaire needs technique work in pass protection, but he is productive with the ball in his hands due to his blend of agility, power and toughness, projecting as an any-down player who can line up across the formation.  Ball security is outstanding. Runs low to the ground with superb bend and balance. 36 percent of his carries were for first downs or touchdowns in 2019. Can cut-and-go without stopping anywhere on field. Quick gather and cut agility laterally or on downhill flow. Has spin move, elongated jump cut, and sudden double cut in his bag.

J.K. Dobbins,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/j-k-dobbins/3200444f-4220-7645-7ee7-94f57d3eed4f,"Good football player who bounced back from a sub-par 2018. Proved he could shoulder a heavy load and rise to the occasion against the best his schedule had to offer. He can make a sudden tackler miss and fits as a one-cut runner, but his running style is more battle axe than buzzsaw as a lunch-pail runner with the fortitude and toughness to wear down defenses. Dobbins isn't going to be that creative back with the wiggle and juice to create something out of nothing, but he has the efficiency, production and third-down value teams covet. Dobbins could land a shared-carries role quickly and has the potential to become a solid NFL starter.
 A three-year starter at Ohio State, Dobbins lined up primarily in one-back sets in Ryan Day’s spread option offense, displaying a natural feel for power, zone and gap schemes. He was productive despite playing with a different starting quarterback each season, joining Archie Griffin as the only Ohio State players to rush for 1,000-plus yards in three different seasons (only OSU player to do it in his first three seasons). Dobbins is very skilled at finding and clearing holes and he makes it a chore on defenders to finish him, chopping his feet in space, stepping out of tackle attempts and maintaining his balance at contact. He benefited from a talented offensive system and when the hole was there, he took advantage, but he isn’t a consistent creator when the play design isn’t properly executed. Overall, Dobbins is built for the pro game and runs with outstanding vision, decision-making and open-field elusiveness, displaying the innate qualities to be a reliable three-down starting running back in the NFL.","Beach body with chiseled, compact build. Big games met with big performances in 2019. Never missed a game and played through pain. Beat on defenses as a high-volume bell-cow in 2019. Steady supply of contact balance to absorb and move forward. Ankle flexion and foot gather for tighter cuts on stretch plays. Talented at slipping inside of overflow pursuit. Good peripheral vision once he's up to the second level. Runs with low, squared pads. Will drop and finish with pop. Runs with efficiency and rarely gets cute. Very effective and subtle selling slip-screen. Separates and puts yards after catch together on angle routes. Will step in and smack an A-gap blitzer.
Above-average vision to survey, anticipate holes and set up his moves…patiently reads and trusts the play design, always knowing where the next block is coming from…developed body type with thick legs, hips and torso…built low to the ground and keeps his legs churning, making him tough to ground…open-field power to run through contact, unleashing a forceful stiff arm…displays a natural feel for proximity and run angles at the second level, shaking would-be tacklers or weaving around defenders…runs with loose hips to efficiently cut off his plant foot…maintains his acceleration downfield to out-pace pursuit…eager lead blocker on quarterback-designed runs…steps up in the hole in pass protection, delivering an upward punch or shoulder to remove rushers from their feet…improved ball skills and can be more than a screen receiver…durable and built to handle positional punishment…team captain…zero concerns with his football or personal character (NFL scout: “Ohio State doesn’t like him – they love him. And I mean everyone. Coaches, teammates, the janitor. Great kid.”)…tireless worker…no stranger to adversity and matured at a young age after his father died…highly productive career, becoming the only player in school history to reach 2,000 rushing yards in a season…finished his career ranked second on the school’s all-time rushing list (4,459), behind only Archie Griffin.

Average vision and creativity in traffic. Doesn't change speed to keep linebackers guessing. Slight gear down to cut. Has ""make you miss,"" but not a wiggle monster in space. Doesn't play with juicy burst inside or to the edge. More rugged than explosive near line of scrimmage. Below average stop-start quickness to stack moves and go. Needs to give more help to his linemen when rushers begin leaking.
Runs with savvy quickness, but not start/stop explosion…lacks the dynamic burst to be a consistent creator when he can’t set up his moves or the hole isn’t there…needs a half-second to regain his speed after his initial momentum is slowed…shorter arms and doesn’t have a sizeable catch radius…effective in pass pro when able to set and extend into his target, but needs technique work to better anchor and absorb rushers…needs to eliminate the easy drops, leaving production on the field…five career fumbles, including three in 2019…injuries were not an issue at Ohio State, but wasn’t himself in the 2019 Fiesta Bowl vs. Clemson due to a sprained left ankle; missed his senior year in high school after breaking his right fibula (August 2016). 
Fumble issues late in 2019 season ; Good, but not elite, speed ; Will need development in blitz protection ;Summary:  During Urban Meyer’s run at Ohio State, the Buckeyes were a factory for NFL talent, producing one excellent draft class after another. Perhaps there was no position that they were more dominant on the field at as running back. The Buckeyes’ rushing attack carried them to roll over the Big Ten during Meyer’s tenure via a string of talented running backs. Thus, it says a lot about J.K. Dobbins when he became a starter in his very first game of college football.

Zack Moss,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zack-moss/32004d4f-5375-6406-2efb-a60ab36c4cc4,"Watching Moss' game tape is like watching an exercise in controlled violence on just about every carry, but his vision, balance, patience and wiggle are additional skills that help to make him a well-rounded runner. Personnel evaluators for NFL teams say there is wear and tear that could limit the length of his career. He needs to become more discerning with his physical challenges if he wants to see a second contract. He is a great fit for gap and inside, zone-heavy rushing attacks and could become an effective starter as a middle-round pick.
A three-year starter at Utah, Moss lined up primarily in the shotgun in one-back sets for the Utes, producing in both gap and zone looks. He leaves Utah with the school records for career rushing yards (4,067), career rushing touchdowns (38) and 100-yard rushing games (19). Moss displays instinctive run qualities and forces missed tackles with his striking combination of body control, nimble feet and finishing mentality. With the way he attacks contact and plays through pain, there is no questioning his toughness, but his injury history makes durability a strong concern. Overall, Moss’ contact balance, smooth cutting skills and competitive play personality allow him to consistently create yardage, projecting as an NFL starter with every-down potential if the medicals stay clean. ","Well-built with power dispersed throughout. Both patient and urgent gears at his disposal. Runs with rare calm in the face of early penetration. Underrated vision to process and game plan beyond the line of scrimmage. Adequate burst inside with feel for the contour of the running lane. Short-stepping running style with elite contact balance. Arm tacklers might want to call in sick. Absorbs contact like a cement truck. Spin moves toss tacklers aside. Drops and squares pads as a finisher. Small space power to move the chains and find the paint. Has ability to handle third down duties if called into action.
Elite run balance to squirm out of tackle attempts, keeping his feet through contact…punishing finisher…doesn’t admit defeat as a runner and bursts into contact, delivering a little extra into defenders and bouncing off hits like they’re an evening breeze…built with a solid core and powerful hips…agile runner with lateral cut-and-go skills to keep defenders off balance…allows blocks to develop and quickly clears holes…patient, but decisive as an upfield decision-maker, sensing defenders around him…admirable run toughness, using a strong stiff arm…competitive in pass protection, squaring up and slowing rushers…productive when targeted as a pass catcher…put several explosive plays on his film (accounted for 16 plays of 25+ yards in 2019)…plays through pain and wasn’t healthy for most of his junior (ankle) and senior (shoulder) seasons…productive career, becoming the first player with three 1,000-yard rushing seasons. 
Runs hard ; Has an element of speed ; Good vision ; Decent feet ; Quickness to hit the hole ; Can accelerate into the open field ; Serious ability pick up yards after contact ; Will power through tacklers ; Short-yardage and goal-line back ; Can push the pile; Has some moves to doge tacklers ; Can contribute as a receiver ; Three-down-starter ability ; Strong build ; Can handle a big workload","Tight hips limit turn radius on first and second level. Additional gather steps before making the cut. Average overall game speed. More likely to elude and punish rather than string moves together. Running style could lead to durability concerns. Had season-ending surgery on meniscus in 2018. Quicker than fast and unlikely to run away from NFL speed. Fumbling has been a small concern in the past. 
Only average start/stop acceleration…can be caught from behind and won’t erase pursuit angles…needs to keep a consistent weight, bouncing between 205 and 220 pounds while at Utah…durability is a red flag – missed the final five games as a junior after he aggravated a pre-existing issue and his knee “locked up” while getting into bed (November 2018); played through a right ankle injury for much of his junior season (September 2018); diagnosed with a grade two AC sprain in his left shoulder, missing one game (September 2019), but requiring injections down the stretch to finish the season. 
Lacks elite speed ; Significant medical concerns ; Slow 40 raises speed worries ; A little stiffness ;Summary:  Over the past three seasons, Moss was one of the most steady and consistent backs in college football, carrying the Utes offense. As a sophomore in 2017, he averaged 5.5 yards per carry for 1,173 yards with 10 touchdowns. He made 29 receptions for 243 yards that season. Moss then impressed evaluators in 2018, carrying the Utes’ offense on their way to a 9-5 season. On the year, he averaged 6.1 yards per carry for 1,096 yards with 11 touchdowns. He could have been a second-day pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, but decided to return for his senior year. ;In 2019, Moss averaged six yards per carry for 1,416 yards and 15 touchdowns. He also had 28 catches for 388 yards and two scores. After the season, Moss hurt himself with a slow 40 at the combine of 4.65 seconds, but more important than his 40 time was his medical exam, as teams across the league have significant medical concerns about Moss even though he was mostly durable at Utah.",UTAH,86,RB,Buffalo Bills,2020,"Watching Moss' game tape is like watching an exercise in controlled violence on just about every carry, but his vision, balance, patience and wiggle are additional skills that help to make him a well-rounded runner.

Darrynton Evans,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/darrynton-evans/32004556-4111-6537-4adc-98552053123e,"Slashing outside-zone runner with glide in his stride and ability to run with elusiveness and creativity. Evans is a little undersized and might be viewed as a change-of-pace option, but he appears to have the three-down skill set to handle committee carries. He can run with patience, but has the loose hips and agile feet to plant-and-go in a hurry. He sees the field and does a nice job of setting up and eluding tacklers with lateral cuts or stacked moves. While he's confident in space, Evans lacks the commitment and finishing force to make a living inside the tackles. His third-down and kick-return versatility increases the likelihood that Evans will hear his name called in the middle rounds with a chance to become a solid RB2.
 A two-year starter at Appalachian State, Evans was the featured runner in former head coach Eli Drinkwitz’s zone-heavy run scheme. Over his first two seasons, he returned kicks and bounced between running back and slot receiver on the depth chart before becoming the top running back midway through the 2018 season when Jalin Moore went down with an injury. Evans is a speedy, one-cut runner who feels openings, presses the hole and makes quick decisions to attack the second level. While competitive as a runner, he isn’t powerful and won’t be a high-volume yards-after-contact runner vs. NFL defenses. Overall, Evans might be limited by his lack of size and physicality, but he is a chug-to-daylight runner with excellent peripheral vision, projecting best as a complimentary outsize zone runner with kick return value.","Grabbed larger chunks of production pie in both 2018 and 2019. Has talent as one-cut back in outside zone. Runs low and smooth with plus change of direction quickness. Rare ball security with no fumbles in 482 carries. Hips are fluid and loose for short-area swivel. Takes away tackle angles once he's past second level. Patient runner who sets up open-field tacklers, leaving their feet in mud. Sneaky leak out on screens with quick run after the catch. Proven effective as kick returner. Aggressive lead shoulder on blitz pickup and chip blocks.

","Lacking determination as inside runner. Decelerates and tucks into interior contact. Needs better recognition to find cutbacks. A little inconsistent navigating run lanes at times.

AJ Dillon,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/aj-dillon/32004449-4c23-7740-624c-afbd67329c54,"Built like a minibus but possessing enough vision and finesse to avoid being pigeon-holed as just a pure power back. Dillon is capable of handling heavy workloads and wearing down defenses, but there is a concern from evaluators that it's taken a physical toll on him. He's a disciplined runner who trusts his blocking scheme and follows his rush track. He's a good one-cut runner with below-average wiggle but natural power to create yards after contact. Dillon will find more space as he faces fewer loaded boxes as a pro, but dropping weight and adding quickness could be the difference between a future as a committee back or starter.
A three-year starter at Boston College, Dillon was the lead back in former offensive coordinator Mike Bajakian’s pro-style scheme. He led the ACC in rushing as a junior and needed only 31 games to become the program’s all-time leading rusher in yards and touchdowns, finishing his career fourth in the ACC in rushing yards. Built like a brick house, Dillon has some freaky elements to his game with his combination of size, strength and straight-line speed, allowing him to run physical through contact. However, he has heavy feet in his redirect, struggling to string together moves and cleanly navigate through traffic. Overall, Dillon’s inconsistent pad level, creativity and third-down skills are concerns, but he is an athletic workhorse and chore to finish to the ground, projecting as a one-cut NFL power back. ","Carries weight easily on big, well-proportioned frame. Above-average athletic traits for such a big runner. Went for 150-plus rushing yards in almost 42 percent of his career starts. Finds paydirt, with 39 career rushing touchdowns. Can move piles or leap over them. Absorbs contact like a big linebacker. Trusts the process and follows design of the rush track. Reads block development and acts decisively. Has grind-it-out mentality, but pitch plays and outside zone suits him. Stiff-arm cleans up the angles on the perimeter. Able to sort the rush and find his protection most of the time. Size to square and slow charging linebackers. 
 Brawny physique with thick legs, knotted calves and strong trunk (and very little fat)…runs as physical as he looks with the core strength to fight through tackle attempts…good vision at the line of scrimmage to locate his blocks and clear the first wave…accelerates through the hole with better speed than expected for a back that size…stays square to the line of scrimmage…limited sample size as a pass catcher, but showed solid hands to be a serviceable screen target…tough-minded as a blocker, both in pass protection and as a lead blocker…durable and built to handle the load…elite production, leaving as Boston College’s all-time leading rusher.","May need to play lighter for increased quickness. Ran odometer high through rough terrain in BC offense. Scouts concerned about long-term durability. Not much creativity to elude sudden traffic in his face. One-cuts when deeper press of the line is needed. Burst to second level is just OK. Needs to square and accelerate into contact more consistently. Not a natural pass-catcher. Feet get stagnant taking on moving targets against blitz. 
Runs tall into contact with inconsistent pad level, allowing defenders to strike low and drive him backwards…bad habit of stopping his feet in the backfield…his cuts lack control, struggling to avoid his own blockers…slowed too easily by contact…takes a moment to get going after his momentum is stopped…sets up his first move, but doesn’t have the wiggle or vision to create at the second or third levels…physical enough to get the job done in pass pro when he can stay square, but quick blitzers will get around him…only 21 career catches in college…fumbled eight times over his career…missed two games as a sophomore with a left ankle sprain (October 2018); fractured the fibula in his right leg (October 2016), ending his senior year in high school.

Overall, Dillon’s inconsistent pad level, creativity and third-down skills are concerns, but he is an athletic workhorse and chore to finish to the ground, projecting as a one-cut NFL power back.  Carries weight easily on big, well-proportioned frame. Above-average athletic traits for such a big runner. Went for 150-plus rushing yards in almost 42 percent of his career starts. Finds paydirt, with 39 career rushing touchdowns. Can move piles or leap over them. Absorbs contact like a big linebacker. Trusts the process and follows design of the rush track. Reads block development and acts decisively. Has grind-it-out mentality, but pitch plays and outside zone suits him. Stiff-arm cleans up the angles on the perimeter. Able to sort the rush and find his protection most of the time. Size to square and slow charging linebackers. 
 Brawny physique with thick legs, knotted calves and strong trunk (and very little fat)…runs as physical as he looks with the core strength to fight through tackle attempts…good vision at the line of scrimmage to locate his blocks and clear the first wave…accelerates through the hole with better speed than expected for a back that size…stays square to the line of scrimmage…limited sample size as a pass catcher, but showed solid hands to be a serviceable screen target…tough-minded as a blocker, both in pass protection and as a lead blocker…durable and built to handle the load…elite production, leaving as Boston College’s all-time leading rusher. May need to play lighter for increased quickness. Ran odometer high through rough terrain in BC offense. Scouts concerned about long-term durability. Not much creativity to elude sudden traffic in his face. One-cuts when deeper press of the line is needed. Burst to second level is just OK. Needs to square and accelerate into contact more consistently. Not a natural pass-catcher. Feet get stagnant taking on moving targets against blitz. 
Runs tall into contact with inconsistent pad level, allowing defenders to strike low and drive him backwards…bad habit of stopping his feet in the backfield…his cuts lack control, struggling to avoid his own blockers…slowed too easily by contact…takes a moment to get going after his momentum is stopped…sets up his first move, but doesn’t have the wiggle or vision to create at the second or third levels…physical enough to get the job done in pass pro when he can stay square, but quick blitzers will get around him…only 21 career catches in college…fumbled eight times over his career…missed two games as a sophomore with a left ankle sprain (October 2018); fractured the fibula in his right leg (October 2016), ending his senior year in high school.

Eno Benjamin,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/eno-benjamin/32004245-4e13-1505-4267-e7260b30dd7d,"Slightly undersized three-down option with unorthodox running style that can keep everyone on the field guessing, including his own team. Benjamin thrives when runs go off schedule but also has a habit of taking them off schedule prematurely. His elusiveness is always on display, but he's a competitive, tough runner when it is time to get down. Benjamin needs a spread-based running game that allows for more space and freedom but must become more decisive as an NFL back. He offers value in a dual run-catch capacity on Day 2 (Rounds 2-3).
 A two-year starter at Arizona State, Benjamin was the feature runner in former offensive coordinator Rob Likens’ one-back, shotgun scheme, becoming the first Sun Devils player since 1974-75 to surpass 1,000 yards rushing in back-to-back seasons. Despite declined production as a junior, there weren’t as many holes to run through. Although he was often overworked in college, Benjamin ran with physical determination every time he touched the ball, which often equated to production. He is at his best when the play is well defined and he can make one cut and go. Overall, Benjamin isn’t overly dynamic or creative by NFL standards, but he runs with a low center of gravity and displays the pro-level toughness to handle whatever is asked of him.","Excellent three-down production as starter. When you think he's tackled, he's not. Eludes, accelerates and escapes. Changes speed to manipulate edge and turn the corner. Eliminates overpursuit with cutbacks. Runs with excellent competitive streak inside/outside. Staccato footwork to slalom around traffic. Hard-nosed, with plenty of pop as finisher. Alters platform, making him a slippery tackle target. Effective pass catcher and hard to guard out of backfield. Knows where to be and makes an effort in pass pro. 
 Runs low to the ground with strong leg drive and downhill toughness…highly determined ball carrier and never quits fighting forward…finishes through contact with outstanding balance, making him tough to finish if not squared up…start/stop burst to cut away from trouble, shifting his weight well laterally…reliable hands as a pass catcher…improved awareness in pass protection to spot pressures pre-snap…already owns a professional approach and always focused on improving his game…team captain as a junior and would often help the true freshman quarterback make line calls…physically durable, taking abuse and continuing to do his job…productive two seasons as the starter, setting the school-records for rushing yards in a game (312) and single-season (1,642)","Noticeable drop in production from 2018. Could take time adjusting to a pro-style rush attack. Feels unsure when approaching the muck. One-cut opportunities turn into a series of moves. Spends too much time setting up LBs instead of bursting past. Hip tightness restricts sharpness of downhill cuts. Takes on heavy collisions too often. Occasional focus drops on easy catch attempts. 
Inconsistent decision-maker at the line of scrimmage…spotty vision and needs to locate developing holes quicker…doesn’t consistently run behind his pads…eager to attack the line of scrimmage, but needs to add more patience to his run style and set up his moves…didn’t break as many tackles in 2019 compared to 2018 (open field or at the line of scrimmage)…blocking style is based more on effort than technique, lacking nuance and fundamentals in pass pro…fumbled only once in 2018 compared to six fumbles in 2019…injured his right ankle in January 2017, requiring surgery and sidelining him during 2017 spring drills.

DeeJay Dallas,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/deejay-dallas/32004441-4c41-5290-528d-2115c573d8ed,"Dallas was a high school quarterback who came into Miami as a receiver and converted to running back during the 2017 season. The production is modest and the instincts are a work in progress, but there are flashes of run-lane feel and downhill smoothness that could be a sign of future development. He has size, speed and a surprising amount of pop as a finisher. His contact balance makes him hard to bring down through contact, but he needs to improve his open-field wiggle. He lacks third-down readiness, but his special teams talent should make up for that. The traits and toughness make him an intriguing upside prospect on Day 3.","Played WR and RB at Miami. Added bad weight in 2018, but slimmed down in 2019. Instincts and feel for rush track improved during season. Does a nice job of running tacklers into blocks. Plus burst with decent getaway juice at his disposal. Willing accelerator through contact for heavy forward finish. Slippery to tackle and hard to get down.

He lacks third-down readiness, but his special teams talent should make up for that. The traits and toughness make him an intriguing upside prospect on Day 3. Played WR and RB at Miami. Added bad weight in 2018, but slimmed down in 2019. Instincts and feel for rush track improved during season. Does a nice job of running tacklers into blocks.

He's not much of a third-down option, but his history as a punt-team gunner works in his favor. Impressive burst to race past second level. Able to take away downhill angles for support safeties. Plenty of juice to threaten perimeter on stretch plays. Change of pace slasher. Subtly alters his rush track to his advantage during the run. Fleet feet constantly on the move. Able to make quality open field cuts. Ball security has been good, with one fumble over the past two years. Showed ability to handle gunner duties in 2018. Nice agility for lateral cut and go. Slippery to tackle. Offers no pass protection help. Hasn't been used for any meaningful pass-catching duties. Unafraid of interior running but is not built for it. Durability could be a concern. Always hurrying and could cut with better patience. Rarely gathers and reassess his run options as an improvisational creator. Not as elusive as expected. Doesn't slow his pace and set up tacklers to miss with wiggle.",backgood goodburst burstaverage averagesize sizecould couldlimit limitnfl nflsuitors good average size limit suitors. calaisfairly fairlytalented talentedcourageous courageouszone zonerunner runnerpro prolikely likelyconsidered consideredgadget gadgetback backmakes makesliving livingopen openspace calais fairly talented courageous zone pro likely considered gadget makes living open space. playspeed speedgives giveschance chanceneeds needsrun runbetter betterpatience patienceimprove improvecontrol controlelusiveness elusivenessopen openfield play gives chance needs better patience improve control elusiveness open field. muchoption optionhistory historygunner gunnerworks worksfavor much option history gunner works favor. impressiveburst burstrace racepast pastsecond secondlevel impressive race past second level. abletake takeaway awaydownhill downhillangles anglessupport supportsafeties able take away downhill angles support safeties. plentyjuice juicethreaten threatenperimeter perimeterstretch stretchplays plenty juice threaten perimeter stretch plays. changepace paceslasher change pace slasher. subtlyalters altersrush rushtrack trackadvantage advantagerun subtly alters rush track advantage. fleetfeet feetconstantly constantlymove fleet feet constantly move. ablemake makequality qualityopen openfield fieldcuts able make quality open field cuts. ballsecurity securitygood goodone onefumble fumblepast pasttwo twoyears ball security good one fumble past two years. showedability abilityhandle handlegunner gunnerduties duties2018 showed ability handle gunner duties 2018. niceagility agilitylateral lateralcut cutgo nice agility lateral cut go. slipperytackle slippery tackle. offerspass passprotection protectionhelp offers pass protection help. usedmeaningful meaningfulduties used meaningful duties. unafraidinterior interiorrunning runningbuilt unafraid interior built. durabilitycould couldconcern durability concern. alwayshurrying hurryingcould couldcut cutbetter betterpatience always hurrying cut better patience. rarelygathers gathersreassess reassessrun runoptions optionsimprovisational improvisationalcreator rarely gathers reassess options improvisational creator. elusiveexpected elusive expected. slowpace paceset settacklers tacklersmiss misswiggle slow pace set tacklers miss wiggle. ,impressiveburst burstrace racepast pastsecond secondlevel impressive race past second level. abletake takeaway awaydownhill downhillangles anglessupport supportsafeties able take away downhill angles support safeties. plentyjuice juicethreaten threatenperimeter perimeterstretch stretchplays plenty juice threaten perimeter stretch plays. changepace paceslasher change pace slasher. subtlyalters altersrush rushtrack trackadvantage advantagerun subtly alters rush track advantage. fleetfeet feetconstantly constantlymove fleet feet constantly move. ablemake makequality qualityopen openfield fieldcuts able make quality open field cuts. ballsecurity securitygood goodone onefumble fumblepast pasttwo twoyears ball security good one fumble past two years. showedability abilityhandle handlegunner gunnerduties duties2018 showed ability handle gunner duties 2018. niceagility agilitylateral lateralcut cutgo nice agility lateral cut go. slipperytackle slippery tackle. ,offerspass passprotection protectionhelp offers pass protection help. usedmeaningful meaningfulduties used meaningful duties. unafraidinterior interiorrunning runningbuilt unafraid interior built. durabilitycould couldconcern durability concern. alwayshurrying hurryingcould couldcut cutbetter betterpatience always hurrying cut better patience. rarelygathers gathersreassess reassessrun runoptions optionsimprovisational improvisationalcreator rarely gathers reassess options improvisational creator. elusiveexpected elusive expected. slowpace paceset settacklers tacklersmiss misswiggle slow pace set tacklers miss wiggle. ,backgood goodburst burstaverage averagesize sizecould couldlimit limitnfl nflsuitors good average size limit suitors. calaisfairly fairlytalented talentedcourageous courageouszone zonerunner runnerpro prolikely likelyconsidered consideredgadget gadgetback backmakes makesliving livingopen openspace calais fairly talented courageous zone pro likely considered gadget makes living open space. playspeed speedgives giveschance chanceneeds needsrun runbetter betterpatience patienceimprove improvecontrol controlelusiveness elusivenessopen openfield play gives chance needs better patience improve control elusiveness open field. muchoption optionhistory historygunner gunnerworks worksfavor much option history gunner works favor. ,0.9450450989204697,0.026588207691918466,0.0,0.0,0.0017134999414040988,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05324140113812607,-0.504129394342906,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
Joshua Kelley,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joshua-kelley/32004b45-4c27-2420-b6d2-7125878e440b,"Physical, downhill runner best-suited for gap-scheme rushing attack. On most carries, it feels like Kelley is playing a game of chicken against defenders when he ducks his head and hits the accelerator into contact. He's going to create some yardage after contact and break tackles here and there, but he tends to become a tackle magnet who is not able to make tacklers miss. He's a tough runner with short-yardage ability and maybe even third-down value. Kelly's strong showing at the Senior Bowl and the NFL Scouting Combine have bolstered his stock and put him squarely on the map as a coveted Day 3 pick.
 A two-year starter at UCLA, Kelley was the starting back in head coach Chip Kelly’s up-tempo scheme, learning from running backs coach and former Bruins back DeShaun Foster. He left a full scholarship at UC Davis and bet on himself by walking on at UCLA, earning a scholarship during 2018 fall camp from a different head coach (Kelly) than the head coach (Jim Mora Jr.) when he arrived. Kelley is an attitude runner who won’t go to the ground easily, maximizing each time he touches the ball. More quick than explosive, he doesn’t have dynamic make-you-miss skills and must become more reliable in pass pro. Overall, Kelley isn’t a joystick athlete and might not be great in any one area, but he is a well-rounded back with the competitive drive that helps translate to football production. ","Size and strength runner. Accelerates downhill and runs aggressively behind pads as TD-maker. Absorbs contact and falls forward to finish his runs. Does not back down from handling the hard work. Didn't get enough blocking help but created for himself with power. Strong lower body to dismiss upper body tackles. Runs with square pads. Quick hands to stab and secure high throws. Size and spirit to become decent protection option. 
Well-strapped-together body type…natural feel for run angles to dart through the first wave…able to cut and accelerate, staying afloat through arm tackles…balanced through traffic and rarely content as a runner…stays north-south and behind his pads to slam inside…better receiving skills than his production suggests, motioning out to wide receiver and adjusting to throws outside his frame…takes care of the football (three fumbles on 492 offensive touches at UCLA)…spirited football character and innately motivated…well-respected by his teammates (UCLA LB Krys Barnes: “He brings joy to the locker room.”)…became the eighth running back in school history with back-to-back 1,000-yard rushing seasons. ","Running style takes a toll on him. Doesn't try to make many people miss. Drops head and rams forward rather than surveying for more moves and yards. Tight hips hinder ability to transition from cut to cut. Forward lean works against him from a balance standpoint. Slow to gather and cut downhill. Below-average start-stop and lateral change of direction. Crowds blockers and lacks feel for the contours of the run lane. Below-average vision to reroute the run. 
Ordinary elusive traits and his burst tends to be sporadic…doesn’t always show the juice required to out-pace linebackers…inconsistent vision and has a tough time improvising when the run design isn’t there…contact-driven mentality, but his body would appreciate it if he occasionally embraced the path of least resistance…too easily slowed at contact and requires a moment to recover his momentum…expected better refinement in pass protection and must improve his awareness as a blocker…missed two games as a senior due to a right knee injury (August 2019).

D'Andre Swift,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/d-andre-swift/32005357-4922-8476-53db-e64aaf6e01f5,"Swift possesses the play traits and running style of a skillful NFL veteran and is the latest in an avalanche of talented Georgia backs. Tempo and decisiveness are his calling cards, making him a highly talented inside/outside zone runner. He's a cerebral runner who understands block timing and uses quick-cut agility and rare spatial awareness to read and react to defenses beyond the second level. Swift isn't overly explosive as a home-run hitter and doesn't run with the violence of last year's top running back, Josh Jacobs. He can step right in and provide early stability and production as an efficient, every-down back with Offensive Rookie of the Year potential.","Compact build with strong lower body and three-down talent. Understands blocking schemes and trusts his big guys up front. Reads overflowing linebackers on zone carries making early run-lane adjustments. Rare feel and vision in tight quarters as interior runner. Listens to fluidity of the crease and takes what it gives him. Effective jump-cut allows him to press runs deep into the hole. Tremendous feel for spatial relationship. Maintains balance through twists, turns and contact. Gets right on top of tacklers before cutting. Quick to find acceleration after slowing his feet. Can run expanded route tree and separate out of breaks. Hands are soft and sticky as pass-catcher. Willing to step into pass protection duties and has some dog in him.","Ball security is well below NFL standards, with a low carries-per-fumble mark. Quicker than fast, lacking home-run burst. Get-away burst to the outside is just average. Doesn't move piles or finish with plus authority. Ends up working harder than other backs to find explosive runs. Will need to learn to use his hands in pass protection. Doesn't always trust the vision as a short-yardage back. ",GEORGIA,35,RB,Detroit Lions,2021,"Swift possesses the play traits and running style of a skillful NFL veteran and is the latest in an avalanche of talented Georgia backs. Tempo and decisiveness are his calling cards, making him a highly talented inside/outside zone runner. He's a cerebral runner who understands block timing and uses quick-cut agility and rare spatial awareness to read and react to defenses beyond the second level. Swift isn't overly explosive as a home-run hitter and doesn't run with the violence of last year's top running back, Josh Jacobs. He can step right in and provide early stability and production as an efficient, every-down back with Offensive Rookie of the Year potential. Compact build with strong lower body and three-down talent. Understands blocking schemes and trusts his big guys up front. Reads overflowing linebackers on zone carries making early run-lane adjustments. Rare feel and vision in tight quarters as interior runner. Listens to fluidity of the crease and takes what it gives him. Effective jump-cut allows him to press runs deep into the hole. Tremendous feel for spatial relationship. Maintains balance through twists, turns and contact. Gets right on top of tacklers before cutting. Quick to find acceleration after slowing his feet. Can run expanded route tree and separate out of breaks. Hands are soft and sticky as pass-catcher. Willing to step into pass protection duties and has some dog in him. Ball security is well below NFL standards, with a low carries-per-fumble mark. Quicker than fast, lacking home-run burst. Get-away burst to the outside is just average. Doesn't move piles or finish with plus authority. Ends up working harder than other backs to find explosive runs. Will need to learn to use his hands in pass protection. Doesn't always trust the vision as a short-yardage back.

Breece Hall,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/breece-hall/32004841-4c18-9796-85f0-25933f010ae8,"Will give NFL evaluators early starter vibes with his blend of size, power and creativity. Hall isn't very sudden in tight quarters but gets better as the run play progresses with good vision and an above-average sense for how to beat second-level tacklers. He has surprising build-up speed once he's in the open field but might not have the instant gas to become a plus outside runner. His running style is willful when it needs to be and he's adept at moving the chains on ""got to have it"" short-yardage carries. Hall has full-package, three-down talent with surprisingly soft hands out of the backfield and should find early touches as a Day 2 draft pick with above-average potential.

A three-year starter at Iowa State, Hall was entrenched as the starter since his freshman year in offensive coordinator Tom Manning’s zone scheme.Overlooked as a high school recruit, Hall quickly established himself as one of college football’s top ball carriers (finished top-10 in the Heisman voting as asophomore and junior), setting an FBS record with a rushing touchdown in 24 consecutive games. Hall, who is Iowa State’s all-time leading scorer, has a strongunderstanding of his strengths as a player and is a disciplined athlete by nature. He posted outstanding testing numbers, but there are times on tape you wish heshowed more of an escape gear. Overall, Hall has room to improve as a blocker and pass catcher and he doesn’t consistently play up to his testing numbers, but heruns with outstanding patience, vision and athletic footwork to be a starting-caliber back in the NFL. He projects best in a zone-based scheme (inside or outside).","
Has the size of a high-volume back.
Touchdown monster from all ranges.
Finished career with five touchdown runs of 75 or more yards.
Gets around the field with good bend and balance.
Recognizes lane development before it happens.
Changes foot cadence for unpredictable burst point.
Sets up second-level tacklers to fail.
Patient behind lead blockers, steering them into defenders.
Makes rhythmic cuts with no loss of speed to beat open-field tacklers.
Powerful base absorbs contact and stays on his feet.
Drops pads and hammers through tacklers while falling forward.
Set of skills to become an above-average third-down option.


 Well-distributed body mass built to handle the load … skilled at forcing missed tackles with his lateral agility and vision … able to slam on the brakes andsmoothly redirect his cuts … his blocking scheme patience usually pays off for him, allowing the point of entry to develop … impressive play strength throughcongestion … drops his pads and finishes with contact balance, not making it easy on tacklers … smooth body control as a pass catcher to adjust and pull in erraticthrows … gutsy in pass protection with the poise and power to get better … low fumble rate, putting the ball on the ground once every 200 offensive touches incollege … already carries himself like a pro and competes with an overachieving mindset (head coach Matt Campbell: “He has always been ready for the moment.”) …finished his career with 11 school records, including scoring (338), total touchdowns (56) and rushing touchdowns (50).
Three-down starter ability ; Natural running instincts ; Good speed ; Excellent spin move ; Quick feet ; Burst to hit the hole ; Nose for the end end zone ; Acceleration ; Second gear to hit the second level ; Quality route-runner ; Advanced pass blocker ; Gets yards after contact ; Good body lean to run low ; Bends at the knee ; Runs behind his pads ; Can create for himself ; Good vision ; Patience ; Keeps feet going after contact ; Receiving ability ; Quality hands ; Advanced route-running ; Blitz, blocking potential","
Handled heavier workload with 800 touches over three years.
Runs like he's pacing himself.
Not very shifty to elude early traffic in the backfield.
Slight hesitation in his initial read at times.
Jukes himself out of balance.
Average quickness and burst to outpace linebackers laterally.
Will need to play faster and more decisively against NFL speed.


: His impressive stopwatch speed doesn’t always show on tape … average suddenness and doesn’t have multiple gears under the hood … inconsistentpressing the line of scrimmage … he is more of a screen target than proven route runner, and needs further development with his route tempo/depth … he will cut orchest up blockers in pass protection and needs to develop his hand use … his competitive urgency is much more impressive as a runner than blocker.
Good skill set, but overly dominant ; Big work load in college ; Hesitates in the backfield on occasion ;Summary:  Over the past three seasons, Hall was a touchdown machine for Iowa State, dominating Big XII defenses and racking up a ridiculous total of 56 touchdowns – 50 of them on the ground. Hall debuted in 2019 and averaged 4.8 yards per carry for 897 yards and nine touchdowns. He also made 23 receptions for 252 yards and a touchdown that season.

Kenneth Walker III,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kenneth-walker-iii/32005741-4c39-1813-7d3e-48047712136d,"Walker is a compact back with a very powerful, sturdy base. He can find his own yards with twitchy directional change when run-blocking breaks down and possesses plus-rated contact balance to add on to his yardage throughout the game. Walker is a very determined runner who is more reactive than instinctive, which leads to wild shifts in his rush track. He can handle RB1 workload in terms of carries but needs work as a third-down option. Walker would benefit from better rush-track discipline, but his explosiveness and unpredictable style should still lead to success as a future starter.

 A one-year starter at Michigan State, Walker was the featured weapon in offensive coordinator Jay Johnson’s multiple run scheme. After two seasons atWake Forest, he transferred to East Lansing and had a prolific 2021 campaign with 136.3 rushing yards per game and 18 rushing touchdowns, finishing sixth in thevoting for the Heisman Trophy (highest finish by a MSU player since 1988). With his vision and contact balance, Walker generates impressive burst off his plant footto dart away from trouble and break tackles (led the FBS with 89 forced missed tackles in 2021). Once he clears the first wave, he can hit an extra gear to reach thecorner or fend off chasing defenders. Overall, Walker must improve as a pass catcher and pass protector, but his instinctive ability to press the line, set up his cutsand create yardage will translate to the pro game, similar to former Pro Bowler Garrison Hearst. He projects as an immediate NFL starter.","

Zamir White,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zamir-white/32005748-4960-3663-61e2-3aa5c09bf289,"White is a naturally powerful runner with a lower half that is hard to knock off-balance no matter how clean the shot. He's not very dynamic as a runner but is a two-way creator with lateral jump-cuts to avoid tackles and the power to run through them. He's a wide-base runner who should excel in gap and inside zone schemes but his running style might not lend itself to a long career. He has two ACL tears in his background and is unlikely to play on passing downs, but he's a formidable ""thunder"" back waiting to be paired with a ""lightning"" cohort and will give running games a chance to test the resolve of defenses for four full quarters.

A two-year starter at Georgia, White was the lead back in offensive coordinator Todd Monken’s scheme. He led the Bulldogs in rushing the past twoseasons and had a lion’s share of the carries, although he was mainly used on early downs and doesn’t have ideal passing down experience as a receiver and blocker.Nicknamed Zeus, White runs behind his pads and barrels through contact with the body strength and balance to break tackles. Although he isn’t super slippery orcreative, he has the vision, patience and agility to pick and slide through the muck at the line of scrimmage. Overall, White was part of a deep backfield at Georgiaand is unproven on passing downs, but he has the ideal build, footwork and mentality to be a dynamic one-cut runner. He has NFL starting potential if themedicals aren’t a concern.","
Weight-room warrior with five-star physique.
Permanent team captain in 2021.
Loves to play the game with elevated physicality.
Creates with power and elusiveness.
Processes movement and cuts back accordingly.
Absorbs contact like it's nothing.
Lateral cuts come easily for being a power back.
Can obliterate lesser tacklers or the uncommitted.
Vision to find a pathway to open field once he hits second level.
Drags tacklers with him to fall forward.


Developed physique that was built from countless weight room hours … physical and instinctive as an inside runner … strong, quick footwork togenerate burst out of his cuts … short-stepper who keeps his feet married to his eyes as he patiently adjusts to the moving parts at the line of scrimmage … lowers hispads and plows forward with point-of-attack violence … runs with a strong foundation and the body balance to break tackles … refuses to go down without a fight …willing in pass protection and will stick his shoulder into the gut of rushers … only three career fumbles … the football field and weight room are his safe spaces andwhere he feels the most comfortable … called a “great leader” by head coach Kirby Smart for the example he sets on the practice field and taking care of his body …has overcome his share of adversity, including multiple knee injuries … led the Georgia in rushing the past two seasons.

Tore right ACL in 2017 and left ACL in 2018.

Very little third-down production during career.

Inconsistent setting up his moves and will cut into contact … one-cut-and-go runner who struggles to string moves together … above-averagestopwatch speed, but it doesn’t always show on the field … wasn’t given many pass protection responsibilities, and shows obvious inexperience … poor foundation asa blocker, and looks out of control adjusting to blitzers … only 21 pass targets in his college career … shared the workload at Georgia (only five career games with 15-plus offensive touches) … the medical feedback will be important after tearing both ACLs: suffered a torn ACL in his right knee in his final high school game (November2017) and tore the ACL in his left knee on a non-contact play in a summer practice (August 2018). 
Good speed, but not elite ; Will need development as a receiver ; Not very elusive ; Will have to learn NFL blitz protection ;Summary:  Georgia has produced a lot of excellent running backs for the NFL over the last decade, and White will continue the tradition set by the likes of Todd Gurley, Nick Chubb, Sony Michel and D’Andre Swift.

Isaiah Spiller,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/isaiah-spiller/32005350-4935-8127-e160-a345616324a2,"Volume-carry running back with good size and talent for starting consideration as a pro. He was slowed, at times, by inconsistent run blocking but was still productive and consistent for much of the 2021 season. He has interior vision and loose hips, allowing him to locate and get to run lanes regardless of traffic. Spiller runs with good elusiveness but stays in that mode a little too long, which can affect his ability to finish with authority. He's a solid back but not overly dynamic and lacks the desired third-down value right now.

A three-year starter at Texas A&M, Spiller broke into the starting lineup as a freshman and has been reliable as the featured back in head coach JimboFisher’s zone-based scheme. Leading the Aggies in rushing three consecutive years, he posted similar production each season with his yards per carry average goingfrom 5.4 to 5.5 to 5.6. Spiller is a good-sized back with the controlled feet, processing speed and tempo to pick through the defense, forcing missed tackles with hisinstincts and contact balance. He is an average athlete and his pass protection must continue to improve, but his ability as a pass catcher alone should keep himplaying on Sundays for a long time. Overall, Spiller needs to be more consistent with his pad level and blocking, but he has outstanding footwork, patience andvision and ties it all together to maximize each carry. He has all the tools to develop into a three-down NFL starter.","
Tape from 2020 shows off talent, with better blocking up front.
Runs with oily hips and good pad level through the carry.
Adequate foot quickness helps to slip backfield leakage.
Effective reading and processing for interior lane choice.
Balance allows for cuts in downhill slalom.
Able to recalibrate his run in the face of sudden roadblocks.
Toggles between patient and urgent when needed.
Lateral acceleration to successfully bounce runs wide.
Uninhibited to make sharp, back-side cuts.
Elusive on the second and third levels.
Very good scan-and-slide to meet incoming blitz.


Instinctive runner with patient, controlled feet to shake defenders … creates his own yardage with his vision and decision-making … sticks his foot in theground and gets north-south with timing … aggressive, determined finisher through holes and into contact … solidly-built and stays square to absorb hits … aboveaverage pass-catcher, especially on angle and wheel routes … catches outside his frame and regularly makes difficult grabs (zero drops in 2021) … willing blocker withthe play strength to get the job done … described as “smart” and “coachable” by the A&M coaching staff … durable and didn’t miss a game over the past threeseasons … consistently productive, finishing his career ranked seventh in school history in rushing yards (2,993) and 19th in scrimmage yards (3,578).

Running style lacks tempo and rhythm at times.
Less decisive and trusting as inside runner in 2021.
Needs to press the line deeper on zone runs.
Average vision when run is spilled wide.
Some inefficiencies getting into his cuts.
Needs to lock into finishing mode sooner to add contact yardage.
Loose with football and targeted for forced fumbles.
Needs better protection technique and hands to be a third-down option.


Taller runner who needs to run with better pad level and forward lean … plays quick and controlled, but his open-field moves aren’t dynamic … missinga fifth-gear to be true home-run threat … his pass protection tends to be hit-or-miss … he is an eager blocker but needs to improve his patience and angles … ballsecurity isn’t a glaring concern with only one fumble in 2021, but fumbled six times in his career … accounted for only 42.8% of the team’s carries in 2021 and therotation helped keep him fresh … minimal special teams experience.
Lacks speed ; Could have problems being effective against fast defenses ;Summary:  In recent years, the SEC has transitioned away from being an old-school hard-nosed running conference into one full of wide-open passing offenses. Spiller must not have gotten the memo, though because he is a physical, hard-charging back who plowed through SEC defenses during his college football career. Spiller ran well as a freshman in 2019, averaging 5.4 yards per carry for 946 yards with 10 touchdowns. He also caught 29 passes for 203 yards. Spiller was even better as a sophomore, averaging 5.5 yards per carry for 1,036 yards and nine touchdowns.

Brian Robinson,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/brian-robinson/3200524f-4273-6177-6c0d-d79eb9d007d1,"Robinson is an absolute physical unit with good feet and power to add yards after contact, but his running style is predictable and somewhat indecisive between the tackles. Building and maintaining momentum doesn't always come easily. He's more fight than flight, but delays in processing and a lack of second-level creativity turn him into more of a road-grader than he needs to be. He is a linear runner who is likely to be utilized as a complementary bulldozer to help wear down defenses, but Robinson might have more potential from sideline to sideline than he receives credit for.

A one-year starter at Alabama, Robinson was the feature running back in offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien’s pro-style scheme. A backup his first fouryears in the program, the Tuscaloosa native patiently waited his turn and took advantage of his opportunity to start in 2021, leading the Tide in rushing. A hungry,downhill runner, Robinson moves like an agile tank with the power to accelerate through contact or the footwork maneuver around it. Although he has only averageburst through the hole and out of his cuts, he appeared more decisive as a senior, which helped him force missed tackles and consistently gain yards after contact.Overall, Robinson isn’t a proven big-play threat, but he is a physical ball carrier with the one-cut instincts and third-down upside to carve out a role in an NFLbackfield similar to Latavius Murray.","

Dameon Pierce,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dameon-pierce/32005049-4524-5478-115c-8ae11dbeefa6,"It's a fun afternoon of tape study watching Pierce play the game like a coiled spring ready to explode on each snap. He's an urgent runner with twitchy downfield burst, tackle-breaking leg drive and outstanding balance through contact. He reads and reacts to block development quickly and creates additional yardage with both power and subtle shiftiness. Pierce was highly productive (16 total touchdowns) in 2021 despite an embarrassingly low usage rate by the coaching staff. He has plenty of tread left on the tires and fits into any run-blocking scheme as a quality future starter or member of a RB tandem.

A one-year starter at Florida, Pierce was part of a backfield rotation in former head coach Dan Mullen’s spread offense (only 374 offensive touches in hiscareer). One of the most productive high school players in Georgia history, he underwhelmed in his first three years in the Gators’ pass-happy offense, but he madethe most of his senior season and impressed when he got on the field. Pierce has a thick lower half and strength through his core and displayed improved reliability in2021 (no fumbles, no drops, steady blocker). He has ordinary speed and can be inconsistent stringing moves together, but he runs through contact with short-areaexplosion and treats every run like it's his last. Overall, Pierce doesn’t have the résumé of a bell-cow back or big-play creator, but he has an NFL build and run stylewith the instincts and finishing skills to be a better pro than college player. He has plenty of tread left on his tires with NFL starting potential in both gap and zoneschemes.","
Grown-man physique.
Unique weight-room power feeds into springy hips/feet.
Averaged a touchdown every seven touches in 2021.
Makes defenses feel his energy and urgency.
No hesitation charging through the line of scrimmage.
Violent runner who is hard to knock off his feet.
Saves the run with top-flight contact balance.
Rare talent to create yardage in a phone booth.
Processes fronts quickly, making wise lane choices.
Able to create suddenly without slowing his feet.
Displayed talent to work the seam over cover linebackers.


: Compactly built, and looks like an NFL back … runs with attitude and power in his legs … outstanding contact balance and feel between the tackles …displays the sharp footwork and body control to hug blocks and burst to open space … eyes and feet stay on the same page … only saw 19 targets in 2021 but caughtevery one, including a few seam and wheel routes … not only a finisher as a ball carrier, but also as a blocker … not shy clearing the road as a lead blocker, and hisphysical chips will put defensive linemen on their backs in pass protection … fumbled three times in college, but zero fumbles in 2021 … the Florida coaches say hisfootball passion is “evident” in practices and games … carries himself with humble confidence that was instilled in him by his parents (went into the stands to thankthe UF band after the 2021 bowl game) … logged 441 special teams snaps (mostly on kickoff coverages) and finished his career with 11 special teams tackles … his 13rushing touchdowns in 2021 were one behind Emmitt Smith’s single-season school record for running backs.

Just nine career games with 10 or more carries.
Herky-jerky runner lacking desired tempo and timing.
Average escape speed out of the side door.
Much more natural off-tackle than between the tackles.
A little tight with change-of-direction transitions.
Needs an extra step to make his downhill cut.
Hand usage in pass pro needs work.


His vision runs hot-and-cold … his speed is average, limiting his ability to attack the perimeter … one-note runner after he clears the first wave … not aproven big-play creator (of his 206 carries the past two years, only two resulted in a 25-plus yard play) … late to lower his pads into contact at times … will invitephysical contact rather than avoiding it … only one season as the starter, and the Florida coaches gave him 15-plus touches in a game only twice in his career (50games played in Gainesville) … never reached 600 yards rushing in any of his four seasons in college. 
Lacks elite speed ; Can be caught from behind ; A little stiffness ; Never was feature back ;Summary:  Over the past few seasons, the Gators had some talented running backs who were used in a platoon fashion by former head coach Dan Mullen. Pierce ran well in limited opportunities as a freshman and sophomore, recording 69 carries, 424 yards, two touchdowns – a 6.1-yard average – in 2018 and 54 carries, 305 yards, four touchdowns – a 5.6-yard average – in 2019. Pierce was given more opportunities as a junior, turning 106 carries into 503 yards – an average of 4.7 yards per carry – and four touchdowns. He also caught 17 passes for 156 yards and a touchdown. In 2021, Pierce took 100 carries but he averaged 5.7 yards per carry for 574 yards and notched 13 touchdowns. He also caught 19 passes for 216 yards and three touchdowns. Pierce played really well as a senior and could have had a huge season if Florida had fielded more consistent quarterback play. After that, Pierce had an excellent week at the Senior Bowl. His 40 at the combine, however, was on the slow side, although that was somewhat expected.",FLORIDA,98,RB,Houston Texans,2022,"It's a fun afternoon of tape study watching Pierce play the game like a coiled spring ready to explode on each snap. He's an urgent runner with twitchy downfield burst, tackle-breaking leg drive and outstanding balance through contact. He reads and reacts to block development quickly and creates additional yardage with both power and subtle shiftiness. Pierce was highly productive (16 total touchdowns) in 2021 despite an embarrassingly low usage rate by the coaching staff. He has plenty of tread left on the tires and fits into any run-blocking scheme as a quality future starter or member of a RB tandem.

A one-year starter at Florida, Pierce was part of a backfield rotation in former head coach Dan Mullen’s spread offense (only 374 offensive touches in hiscareer). One of the most productive high school players in Georgia history, he underwhelmed in his first three years in the Gators’ pass-happy offense, but he madethe most of his senior season and impressed when he got on the field. Pierce has a thick lower half and strength through his core and displayed improved reliability in2021 (no fumbles, no drops, steady blocker). He has ordinary speed and can be inconsistent stringing moves together, but he runs through contact with short-areaexplosion and treats every run like it's his last. Overall, Pierce doesn’t have the résumé of a bell-cow back or big-play creator, but he has an NFL build and run stylewith the instincts and finishing skills to be a better pro than college player. He has plenty of tread left on his tires with NFL starting potential in both gap and zoneschemes.

: Compactly built, and looks like an NFL back … runs with attitude and power in his legs … outstanding contact balance and feel between the tackles …displays the sharp footwork and body control to hug blocks and burst to open space … eyes and feet stay on the same page … only saw 19 targets in 2021 but caughtevery one, including a few seam and wheel routes … not only a finisher as a ball carrier, but also as a blocker … not shy clearing the road as a lead blocker, and hisphysical chips will put defensive linemen on their backs in pass protection … fumbled three times in college, but zero fumbles in 2021 … the Florida coaches say hisfootball passion is “evident” in practices and games … carries himself with humble confidence that was instilled in him by his parents (went into the stands to thankthe UF band after the 2021 bowl game) … logged 441 special teams snaps (mostly on kickoff coverages) and finished his career with 11 special teams tackles … his 13rushing touchdowns in 2021 were one behind Emmitt Smith’s single-season school record for running backs.

Tyrion Davis-Price,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyrion-davis-price/32004441-5682-2552-baf3-6579c14749f1,"Big, athletic back offering an enticing blend of size and explosiveness to go with an SEC pedigree. Davis-Price's early season tape was listless and lacking pro quality, but that changed over the second half of the year. He's an enigmatic back featuring urgency, indecisiveness, physicality and finesse on any given carry. He got much better as the season progressed and clearly finds a rhythm when given volume carries. Scouts say that staying motivated will be a major factor in future success. Davis-Price's athletic ability and hammerhead finishes will help him create yardage. He has the size and upside worthy of consideration in the middle rounds.

A two-year starter at LSU, Davis-Price emerged as the Tigers’ lead back in former offensive coordinator Jake Peetz’s multiple-run scheme (gap and zone).After he was the backup to Clyde Edward-Helaire on LSU’s 2019 national title team, he led the Tigers in rushing each of the past two seasons, breaking the singlegame LSU rushing record with 287 yards vs. Florida in 2021. Davis-Price is a stout runner to grind out short yardage, but he can also mash the gas when he has anopen lane. Although he still has work to do as a pass catcher, he was a closer on the 2021 tape, getting better as the game progressed (3.9 yards per carry in the firsthalf, 5.6 yards per carry in the second half). Overall, Davis-Price isn’t who you turn to if you want creativity or elusiveness, but he is a physical, downhill back whocan break tackles late into games and hold his own in pass protection. He can be part of an NFL rotation well beyond his rookie contract if he stays committed.","
Premium combination of size and athletic talent.
Accelerates and cuts like a smaller back.
Gets better with volume.
Runs with excellent bend.
Talented operating behind a lead blocker.
Attacked the line of scrimmage against Alabama.
Quick to process and secure a back-side cut.
Battering ram in open space.
Drops and collides with tacklers, dragging them for extra yardage.


Big-boned frame with well-proportioned mass … drops his pads between the tackles and absorbs hits, picking up yards post-contact thanks to his runbalance and power … functional vision at the line of scrimmage, and collects his feet to make controlled cuts … above-average open-field speed for his size … one ofthe more consistent pass-blockers in this year’s running back draft class because of his lateral quicks and base strength … his most productive runs came in the secondhalf of games … was at his best late in the season, averaging 123.3 rushing yards per game over the final seven games in 2021 … offers proven durability but alsoplenty of tread still left on the tires.","
Needs better patience to allow smoke to clear up front.
Below-average feel for blocking scheme and run lane.
Slams into a lineman's back on a regular basis.
More stutter-and-go than one-cut runner.
Ball security might be an ongoing issue.
Hands are a coin flip as a pass-catcher.


Runs quick for his size, but not explosive, especially when attempting to stretch runs to the perimeter … inconsistent pacing and feel for where thenext block is coming from … doesn’t receive high marks for creativity … will make too much contact inside, sometimes with his own blockers … not a true make-youmiss ball carrier at the second level … struggled to find the end zone in 2021, scoring a touchdown in only three of his 12 games … didn’t have a drop in 2021, butdidn’t see many targets and is largely unproven besides the occasional dump-off … fumbled three times on 221 touches in 2021 … didn’t play on special teamscoverages in college … averaged less than 5.0 yards per carry each of his three college seasons.",LSU,93,RB,San Francisco 49ers,2022,"Big, athletic back offering an enticing blend of size and explosiveness to go with an SEC pedigree.

Big-boned frame with well-proportioned mass … drops his pads between the tackles and absorbs hits, picking up yards post-contact thanks to his runbalance and power … functional vision at the line of scrimmage, and collects his feet to make controlled cuts … above-average open-field speed for his size … one ofthe more consistent pass-blockers in this year’s running back draft class because of his lateral quicks and base strength … his most productive runs came in the secondhalf of games … was at his best late in the season, averaging 123.3 rushing yards per game over the final seven games in 2021 … offers proven durability but alsoplenty of tread still left on the tires. 
Needs better patience to allow smoke to clear up front.
Below-average feel for blocking scheme and run lane.
Slams into a lineman's back on a regular basis.
More stutter-and-go than one-cut runner.
Ball security might be an ongoing issue.
Hands are a coin flip as a pass-catcher.


Runs quick for his size, but not explosive, especially when attempting to stretch runs to the perimeter … inconsistent pacing and feel for where thenext block is coming from … doesn’t receive high marks for creativity … will make too much contact inside, sometimes with his own blockers … not a true make-youmiss ball carrier at the second level … struggled to find the end zone in 2021, scoring a touchdown in only three of his 12 games … didn’t have a drop in 2021, butdidn’t see many targets and is largely unproven besides the occasional dump-off … fumbled three times on 221 touches in 2021 … didn’t play on special teamscoverages in college … averaged less than 5.0 yards per carry each of his three college seasons.",bigathletic athleticback backoffering offeringenticing enticingblend

Kevin Harris,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kevin-harris/32004841-5245-7260-8be0-ef52c1ce6dea,"Big, bruising runner with good vision and the self-awareness to understand that power running is what will butter his bread. His 2021 productivity fell off from 2020, due in part to health issues, shared carries and average South Carolina run blocking. He creates for himself with contact and tackle-breaking talent, but typically drops and finishes against an open-field tackler rather than avoiding him. He's a chain mover with excellent ball security as a battering ram inside. He will be limited as an outside runner and needs to come off the field on passing downs. Harris has talent and his impressive 2020 was no mirage. He's a good Day 3 option for teams looking to upgrade their power.

Grown man with thickly muscled arms and legs.
Runs with good high-knee action for a big runner.
Knows he's a big back and finishes like it.
Build-up speed for longer runs once he hits the open field.
Good job finding relevant rush tracks.
Capable of reading and cutting off blocks effectively.
Balance to absorb contact and keep it moving.
Just a single fumble over 358 carries at South Carolina.
Consistently shrugs off tackle attempts above the waist.

Had offseason back surgery after 2020.
Lacks early creativity when needed.
Will get walked down by linebackers on outside runs.
Not much open-field shake to elude on second level.
Change of direction saps momentum of the run.
Takes on heavier contact than is necessary.
Catches the football like it's made of lava.

James Cook,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/james-cook/3200434f-4f15-1970-d2e5-e575c819187c,"Change-of-pace runner with vision and flow but a lack of functional play strength. The younger brother of Vikings running back Dalvin Cook, James has his brother's one-cut talent and ability to stack cuts seamlessly through the second level. However, he is missing his big brother's build, contact balance and toughness between the tackles, which will surely cap expectations and asks from an NFL club. His slashing style fits with outside zone and toss plays. He can also be used as a mismatch option as a pass-catcher. Cook has big-play ability but is unlikely to see his carry count get very high.

A part-time starter at Georgia, Cook shared the running back duties with Zamir White in offensive coordinator Todd Monken’s scheme. He averagedbetter than 6.1 yards per carry in each of his four seasons in Athens, and his role expanded as a senior, leading the team in all-purpose yards per game (67.5) and inrushing five times. Cook has shifty feet to make controlled cuts against the grain and instinctively navigate holes at the line of scrimmage. Although he will be limitedas an inside runner, he has legitimate versatility to flex out wide and run routes as a pass catcher. Overall, Cook doesn’t have the contact balance or build of a fulltime ball carrier like his older brother, but he can be a dynamic, versatile threat with his pass-catching skills and balanced athleticism to gravitate toward space.","

Tyler Badie,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyler-badie/32004241-4468-5229-8c1d-59265ee103fc,"Undersized, change-of-pace back with a big heart and pass-catching talent. Despite a lack of desired size, Badie took on a monster workload and produced at a high level. He played in a run scheme heavily tilted to outside zone and is at his best in space, although he's natural and confident in tight run lanes. He's a tough runner but lacks short-yardage leg drive, so his role as a pro could be fairly well-defined as a talented third-down back who can handle an occasional spike in carries if needed.
","
Adequate decisiveness to process the front and hit it.
Maintains optimal spacing from defenders as inside runner.
Relaxed runner to shoot through tight creases.
Low center of gravity with plus contact balance.
Open-field burst catches pursuit off-guard.
Just two fumbles lost on 513 carries.
Experience to run expanded route tree to exploit matchups.
Catches with natural hands inside/outside the frame.
Difficult to bring him down quickly after the catch.


Tremendous receiver ; Soft hands ; Good route-runner ; Dangerous in space ; Elusive ; Shifty runner ; Great vision ; Superb feet ; Runs behind his pads ; Good knee bend ; Can pick up yards after contact ; Superb feet ; Lateral quickness ; Moves in the open field ; Compact build ; Strength to run through arm tackles ; Picks up yards after contact ; Very good balance ; Three-down starter potential","
Runs in segments rather than one, continuous flow.
Below-average ""one-cut"" talent for outside zone.
Fails to recognize back-side cutback opportunities.
More reactive than proactive setting up tacklers.
Not built for tough, short-yardage carries.
Lacks size and strength to drive through arm tackles.
Could struggle to stand in and deliver in blitz protection.


Lacks height ; Smaller catch radius ; Gets knocked back when defenders hit him square ; Has limitations in blitz protection ;Summary:  Badie flashed for Missouri as a backup running back during his freshman through junior years, where he showed some serious receiving ability. While didn’t do much on the ground, Badie caught 28 passes for 333 yards and two touchdowns in 2020 after snatching 32 passes for 356 yards and five touchdowns in 2019. Badie then broke out as a senior, toting the ball out of the backfield and was one of the best running backs in college football. He averaged 6.0 yards per carry in 2021 on his way to 1,604 yards and 14 touchdowns. Badie continued to do damage as a receiver as well, taking 54 catches for 330 yards and four touchdowns. ;There is a lot to like about Badie as a runner. He possesses a nice combination of traits like vision, elusiveness, and superb feet. The elusiveness can be seen with how he cuts around tacklers, spins away, and uses shifty moves to dodge them. His short, compact build adds to the elusiveness, because defenders have a hard time grabbing a hold of him. He has vision that looks natural, letting him see holes about to open and cut-back lanes, and he reads the flow of defenses behind his blockers. His quick feet are great to cut on a dime, provide him with excellent balance. Badie also has strength to his build, which helps him run through tackles and pick up yards after contact.",MISSOURI,178,RB,Baltimore Ravens,2022,"Undersized, change-of-pace back with a big heart and pass-catching talent.

Pierre Strong,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/pierre-strong/32005354-5265-8099-4e5a-fedfdfa80694,"Instinctive running back with NFL traits and talent to find a home as a committee back or an eventual RB1. Hyper-focused vision provides him a variety of cut options and rush paths but also causes him to overthink his approach at times. Strong is more reactive than manipulative but is quite impressive with his spatial awareness and ability to slalom around bodies on a smooth, linear pathway without slowing his roll. He struggles when forced to slow his feet and make early cuts. He needs a north/south run scheme where he can square his pads and find his rhythm quickly. Strong lacks third-down value at this time, but has shown enough to believe it could be in his future.

",SOUTH DAKOTA STATE,118,RB,New England Patriots,2022,"Instinctive running back with NFL traits and talent to find a home as a committee back or an eventual RB1. Hyper-focused vision provides him a variety of cut options and rush paths but also causes him to overthink his approach at times. Strong is more reactive than manipulative but is quite impressive with his spatial awareness and ability to slalom around bodies on a smooth, linear pathway without slowing his roll. He struggles when forced to slow his feet and make early cuts. He needs a north/south run scheme where he can square his pads and find his rhythm quickly. Strong lacks third-down value at this time, but has shown enough to believe it could be in his future.
 
Big-play threat with 10 career rushing TDs of 50-plus yards.
Bends and bursts through line of scrimmage.
Finds the center of the rush lane and avoids first-level defenders.
Internal GPS finds and offers multiple routes during the trip.
Can see and make steep back-side cuts to find open field.

Kyren Williams,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kyren-williams/32005749-4c41-5359-809b-caeaa1db84d0,"Fiery team leader and combative runner who leaves it all out on the field. Williams has been a worker bee with a willingness to do the heavy lifting on all three downs and has premium third-down talent both in blitz pickup and as a route-runner out of the backfield. The Patriots' usage of James White, Dion Lewis and Brandon Bolden might be the blueprint for how to utilize Williams in the NFL.

Williams earned the starting role the past two seasons in offensive coordinator Tommy Rees’ zone-based scheme. He was a slot receiver before he was arunning back in high school and proved himself as an all-purpose weapon for the Irish (was the only FBS player in 2021 to surpass 1,000 yards rushing, 350 yardsreceiving and 100 yards as a return man). Williams is highly effective on counters and cutbacks with the plant-and-go quickness to make strong cuts in any direction.He has limited inside power, but is a problem-solving runner thanks to his sharp footwork and blend of patience and decisiveness. Overall, Williams is an averageathlete and ideally projects as more of a complimentary back in the NFL, but he is an elite competitor with the darting quickness and pass-catching skills to be athird-down weapon.

Rachaad White,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/rachaad-white/32005748-4939-3110-903e-6b6c868dd3ab,"Running back with size and senior year production, but the tape is more average than exciting. White is a tight-hipped runner lacking desired lateral agility and burst after changing direction. He has a tendency to be slowed or stopped by first-level tacklers but is a more natural runner once he gets up to the second level. He fails to show enough creativity to escape the ""gets what is blocked"" tag, but he does run with adequate vision. His lack of breakaway speed and limited special teams background won't help his chances, so he needs to shine early in camp to give himself an opportunity to make a team as a RB3.

A two-year starter at Arizona State, White was the featured back in offensive coordinator Zak Hill’s scheme. From Division II to junior college to Tempe,he took a winding journey to the NFL’s doorstep, but he bet on his talent and work ethic and averaged 6.4 yards per carry during the past two seasons as the SunDevils’ leading rusher. White out-leverages pursuit with his lateral agility and decision-making on the move, which allows him to create chunk plays despite hisaverage top-end speed. Though he needs to improve in pass protection, he is a dependable pass-catcher with tracking skills and body control. Overall, White willleave some production on the field, but his explosive darting run style allows him to collect his feet and find yardage that wasn’t blocked for him. He projects as abackup capable of steady NFL playing time.","
Impressive production as full-time RB1.
Three-down workload of carries and catches.
Desired size and build of an early down running back.
Patient runner reading his block development.
Easy transition from reactive to aggressive when finishing runs.
Can stack cuts when maneuvering around linebackers.
Locates the tight crease and squeezes in near the paint.
Scored at least one touchdown in 9 of 11 games in 2021.


Quick, elusive feet to shake defenders in the hole … shows the lateral agility to avoid the trash and bounce runs wide … keeps his body compact and feetunderneath him to make fast decisions and sharp cuts … his eyes quickly find pursuit to set up moves and force missed tackles … can be a nightmare for a flat-footedsafety in open waters … accelerates cleanly post-cut … feet are constantly moving, helping him escape the grasp and peel off tackle attempts … above-average bodycontrol and pass-catching traits (his 48 targets in 2021 led all Pac-12 backs) … secures catches through contact … has experience running routes from the slot and outwide … plays with a nose for the end zone with 22 touchdowns in 15 games played at ASU (scored multiple touchdowns in eight of those games) ... his coaches callhim “thoughtful” and “mature” and the type of teammate they want in the locker room … accounted for a first down or touchdown on 44.2% of his 224 offensivetouches at ASU.","
Works in ""slow-and-go"" mode when changing directions.
Too tight-hipped for abrupt lateral/diagonal cuts.
Play speed needs a boost.
Too quick to quit on play-side run track on stretch plays.
Allows disappointing success rate on first tackle attempt.
Below-average contact balance to careen and continue.
Too inconsistent to be trusted with protection duties.


 Lean muscle definition throughout his long frame … average long speed, and can be caught from behind … more quick than straight-line fast …ordinary physicality and balance, which slows his momentum through contact … lack of run strength limits his ability to create movement in short-yardage situations… hyper-focused on the man in front of him and not the space he is cutting toward … his patience at the line of scrimmage runs hot and cold … willing in passprotection, but his base and technique are undisciplined … late to recognize and pick up extra pressures … limited return and special teams experience … missed onegame as a senior with a right leg injury (October 2021).

Quick, elusive feet to shake defenders in the hole … shows the lateral agility to avoid the trash and bounce runs wide … keeps his body compact and feetunderneath him to make fast decisions and sharp cuts … his eyes quickly find pursuit to set up moves and force missed tackles … can be a nightmare for a flat-footedsafety in open waters … accelerates cleanly post-cut … feet are constantly moving, helping him escape the grasp and peel off tackle attempts … above-average bodycontrol and pass-catching traits (his 48 targets in 2021 led all Pac-12 backs) … secures catches through contact … has experience running routes from the slot and outwide … plays with a nose for the end zone with 22 touchdowns in 15 games played at ASU (scored multiple touchdowns in eight of those games) ... his coaches callhim “thoughtful” and “mature” and the type of teammate they want in the locker room … accounted for a first down or touchdown on 44.2% of his 224 offensivetouches at ASU. 
Works in ""slow-and-go"" mode when changing directions.
Too tight-hipped for abrupt lateral/diagonal cuts.
Play speed needs a boost.
Too quick to quit on play-side run track on stretch plays.
Allows disappointing success rate on first tackle attempt.
Below-average contact balance to careen and continue.
Too inconsistent to be trusted with protection duties.


 Lean muscle definition throughout his long frame … average long speed, and can be caught from behind … more quick than straight-line fast …ordinary physicality and balance, which slows his momentum through contact … lack of run strength limits his ability to create movement in short-yardage situations… hyper-focused on the man in front of him and not the space he is cutting toward … his patience at the line of scrimmage runs hot and cold … willing in passprotection, but his base and technique are undisciplined … late to recognize and pick up extra pressures … limited return and special teams experience … missed onegame as a senior with a right leg injury (October 2021).

Tyler Allgeier,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyler-allgeier/3200414c-4c70-2582-4cca-1a2070c9a090,"Well-built, highly productive zone-scheme runner with impressive vision and feel for the job. Allgeier is smooth and instinctive with one-cut talent. He effectively navigates the ebbs and flows of run lane development. He's more agile than twitchy and relies on his ability to quickly process. While he sees it clearly, his pace and burst can be a little hit-or-miss and might allow for NFL defenses to prevent the chunk play. Allgeier is clearly talented as a runner but will need to prove his explosiveness. He offers very little third-down value right now and could be tabbed as a solid backup in a move-based rush attack.

A two-year starter at BYU, Allgeier grew into a bell-cow role in first-year offensive coordinator Aaron Roderick’s balanced attack. Over the past twoseasons (24 games), he averaged 113.8 rushing yards and 1.5 rushing touchdowns per game (best in the nation over that span) and finished his career with a 6.4yards-per-carry average (BYU record). A decisive ball carrier, Allgeier shows a lot of the ancillary traits necessary to be productive at the next level and competes withthe attitude and determination of a former walk-on (see his chase-down forced fumble on 2021 Arizona State tape). Although he isn’t overly elusive, he runs througharm tackles with his body strength and contact balance (70.9% of his yardage in 2021 came after initial contact). Overall, Allgeier isn’t an explosive runner, but heruns with an instinctive feel and quick feet for a bigger ball carrier and shows the passing game potential to be an every-down NFL back. He reminds me of ArizonaCardinals RB James Conner.","
Well-built, reliable and productive.
Put it in the paint at an impressive rate.
Had four games with 190-plus rushing yards in 2021.
Vision to maximize the blocking scheme.
Excellent feel for inside/outside zone.
Smooth getting through his reads.
Innate feel for space and run-lane development.
Maintains distance from tacklers in space.
Has the ability to dart into quick, stacked cuts.
Absorbs contact with adequate balance.


Big-boned frame with a solid build … runs with athletic steps/moves, and his eyes and feet are tied together with strings … quick to read his blocks, pressthe hole and make timely cuts … patient but decisive runner with minimal wasted motion (and won’t run up the back of his blockers) … has the contact balance andheavy pads to squeeze through slivers of daylight between the tackles … picks up steam once he gets going with better-than-expected second-level speed … 33.8% ofhis carries in 2021 resulted in a first down or touchdown … reliable screen/check-down option with excellent focus and body control as a pass catcher … effective leadblocker on quarterback runs and stayed alert in pass protection to locate and put his shoulder in the blitzer’s belly … humble by nature and earned his success by outworking everyone with his “nothing is given” attitude … didn’t complain when the coaches moved him to linebacker for most of the 2019 season (26 tackles) …durable and handled a full workload in 2021 while avoiding injury … highly productive 2021 season and finished tied for No. 1 nationally in rushing touchdowns (23)and was one of only four players to reach 1,600 rushing yards to set a BYU single-season record … needed only two seasons to rank top-five in school history inseveral career categories, including rushing yards and rushing touchdowns.","
Runs with average burst through the line.
Doesn't run with power to drive through interior contact.
Fluid but not all that twitched-up.
Average speed to the edge on outside runs.
Fumbles creeped into his game in 2021.
Pass protection will need to improve if he's going to keep defenders off QB.
Hands are not very natural as a pass-catcher.


Not a burst runner, with only average perimeter speed … his ordinary wiggle is a result of his tight hips and inconsistent pad level … his broken tacklesare usually because of force rather than avoiding defenders … runs physical but would benefit from exploding into contact more … can get caught leaning in passprotection, giving rushers a chance to make a move … fumbled six times in college, including four times in 2021 … found himself contained against the top two rundefending teams on the 2021 schedule, averaging just 3.2 yards per carry (42/135/1) vs. Baylor and Utah … only one season (2019) of special teams experience.",BYU,136,RB,Atlanta Falcons,2022,"Well-built, highly productive zone-scheme runner with impressive vision and feel for the job.

While he played the role he was cast into, there were signs (versus Penn State) that he might have some potential as an inside/outside back.

Adequate balance through contact to keep a run alive.
Accustomed to squeezing into small creases along the interior.

Robinson is well-built with a compact lower half and pairs a low center of gravity with agile feet. There are elements of both fight and flight in his running style, but defenders can never be quite sure what they are going to get. He’s a capable inside/outside runner with unique footwork to stack moves and reset pathways, but can plow into tacklers at a moment’s notice using elite contact balance to keep the run rolling. He might need to dial back efforts to search out big runs so frequently and take what is there a little more often to keep from getting bogged down. His pass-catching talent ensures the opportunity for Robinson to see a high number of touches. He has a chance to become one of the more productive runners in the league very quickly.

Jahmyr Gibbs,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jahmyr-gibbs/32004749-4219-8578-ca06-2b870fe6f731,"While Gibbs might not be the engine of an NFL running game, he’s more than capable of adding juice to the offense. He’s a slasher who can stretch defenses wide, and he has the wiggle to elude tacklers in space. However, he could see his effectiveness diminished inside. Gibbs might be better off with a more measured carry count as an RB2, but his versatility and pass-catching prowess will give creative play-callers an opportunity to exploit certain personnel groupings and find mismatches in space.

But after suffering some bad seasons, a lot of quality Yellow Jackets players went under the radar, and that was the case for Gibbs as well. In 2020, Gibbs averaged 5.2 yards per carry for 460 yards and four touchdowns. He also showed impressive receiving ability with 24 catches for 303 yards and three scores.

The new opportunity showed how talented Gibbs was in that he immediately becamse the starting tailback for the Crimson Tide despite the program having a lot of five-star recruits already at the position who had more experience in the offense. In 2022, Gibbs averaged 6.1 yards per carry for 926 yards and seven touchdowns. He also had 44 receptions for 444 yards and three scores.

Gibbs does not have the speed of Chris Johnson, but he is a fast back who provides a speed mismatch out of the backfield. Gibbs is slashing shifty speed back who is in the mold of an Alvin Kamara or Christian McCaffrey. In the NFL, Gibbs will be a threat to break off long runs due to possessing rare quickness for a starting back. ;On top of being fast, Gibbs is a natural runner.

Zach Evans,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/zach-evans/32004556-4181-2057-89cd-cc42654bef9d,"Evans’ career average of 6.9 yards per carry demonstrates his home run ability, but nagging injuries have limited him in the last two seasons. Teams will need to examine his injury history and determine whether it’s a concern for them or not. He has lead back size and impresses with his willingness to fight through contact for additional yardage on most runs. His vision and creativity are average at best, but the talent/traits should put him in contention for early carries as a very good complementary back with future RB1 upside.

Body composition of an NFL lead back.
Burst is sudden and explosive.
Can bounce runs wide and beat pursuit to the corner.
Quick to process and elude versus penetration.
Slashes through leg tackles with contact balance.
Top-end speed for long house calls.
Consistently adds yards to the carry with power.

Charbonnet is a bit of a long-strider with slightly below average foot quickness. He is much more effective when allowed to open up and build downhill momentum. He can slip tackles in the open field but lacks the first-level wiggle to get too cute. He’s inconsistent in processing defensive fronts quickly but can be a hammer into and through contact when he has a clear point of entry. Charbonnet is a talented third-down option as both a blocker and pass-catcher. He could be viewed as a Day 2 value with three-down potential.

Kenny McIntosh,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kenny-mcintosh/32004d43-4950-0298-3acc-043d70d34f9d,"McIntosh is best suited for a complementary role that allows him to explore the flanks of the offense instead of trying to pound and create between the tackles. He lacks the vision to recognize and exploit opportunities quickly and the elusiveness to dart in and out of developing run lanes. He’s more than capable of finding big runs over the tackles and becomes a more physical finisher as the run progresses. McIntosh has excellent hands and the potential to mismatch coverages when isolated out of the backfield. He could become a RB2 with full-time third-down reps.

Jonathon Brooks,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jonathon-brooks/32004252-4f13-1669-de2f-e975d31892d1,"The comparison of Brooks to former Longhorn Jamaal Charles might feel lazy to some, but he has similar size and traits as a runner. Brooks' limited collegiate carries could be seen as a balancing agent against the fact he's coming off an ACL tear. He's agile and smooth working from cut to cut and is likely to improve his feel for reading blocks and setting up defenders as he gains experience. Brooks has the wiggle and know-how to create yardage in tight quarters or in space but is efficient finishing runs when it's time. He has good burst but can be a little hesitant to punch the gas between the tackles until he sees clear points of entry, and he isn't a physical run finisher. Brooks is a runner on an upward trajectory. He's a good pass catcher with three-down potential who should fit nicely as an early starter for zone-heavy teams.
A one-year starter at Texas, Brooks emerged as the Longhorns’ go-to back in head coach Steve Sarkisian’s spread RPO offense, which utilizes both zoneand gap principles. After two years behind Bijan Robinson and Roschon Johnson, he put together an All-America-level season in 2023 prior to suffering a torn ACL(ranked top five in the FBS in rushing at the time of his injury). Despite a wide gait and long legs, Brooks is a controlled, instinctive runner who forces missed tackleswith his subtle ability to set up defenders and string together moves with timely, sharp cuts. He can be inconsistent in short-yardage situations but offers third-downvalue with his promise as a blocker and natural pass-catching traits. Overall, Brooks is a springy, balanced athlete with a feel for lane development and the elusivetraits to create his own yardage, both at the line of scrimmage and on the second level. Stylistically, he reminds me of Kenyan Drake, although Brooks has muchbetter vision and big-play potential (assuming he returns to his pre-injury form).","
Tires should be full of tread, given that he has just 238 collegiate carries to his name.
NFL-caliber accelerator as an outside runner.
Flows through run lanes with excellent bend and quickness.
Slick feet allow him to make light work of stacking cuts and moves.
Outstanding spatial awareness to create maximum work space as a runner.
Usually avoids unnecessary moves and finishes runs when it's time.
Good hands and great post-catch wiggle create added value for offenses.

Shifty athlete with outstanding run balance and vision … skillfully presses the hole and sets up defenders with subtle juke steps, forcing tacklers to diveat ankles (credits Texas RB coach Tashard Choice for developing his elusiveness, especially at the second level) … instantly changes gaps (and frustrates linebackers)with his explosive jump cuts … able to breeze through arm tackles with his initial acceleration through holes and in/out of his cuts … sticky hands as a receiver withthe body control and catch radius to pull in off-target throws … dangerous target in the flat with his ability to make the first man miss … blocks with the awarenessand toughness needed for pass pro … only one fumble in college … described as a “genuine” person by his teammates and as an “invaluable” leader by head coachSteve Sarkisian; had such an impact that Sarkisian sent him on the field for the final snap (victory formation) of the 2023 Big 12 Championship Game (just weeks postACL surgery) … averaged north of 6.0 yards per carry in each of his three seasons in Austin.
Impressive burst for a big back ; Second gear ; Accelerates downfield ; Three-down starter ability ; Strong build ; Natural running instincts ; Patient; Quick feet ; Nose for the end zone ; Another gear to hit the second level ; Gets yards after contact ; Good body lean to run low ; Bends at the knee ; Runs behind his pads ; Can create for himself ; Good vision ; Keeps feet going after contact ; Has upside for passing game","
Suffered torn ACL in November that ended his season.
Still learning to press the hole and set up blockers on zone runs.
Needs to run with more pace in choosing his lanes against pro speed.
Power into and through contact is just average.
Will need to square up rushers and limit lead-shoulder block approach.

Tall, well-defined body type but leaner than ideal with inconsistent power and pad level … guilty of making too many moves in the backfi eld when theread calls for him to get downhill in short yardage … shows patience on one play, not enough the next … bl ocking skill set is promising, but he prefers to slam hisshoulder into blitzers instead of setting up shop and using his hands … saw just 46 snaps on special teams … medical evaluation will be important after he suffered atorn ACL in his right knee (November 2023), which required surgery and sidelined him for the remainder of the season and the draft process; also battled injury as asophomore and had bilateral hernia surgery the day after the bowl game (December 2022), which sidelined him for most of 2023 spring practices … only threequarters of a season’s worth of starting production.

Outstanding spatial awareness to create maximum work space as a runner.
Usually avoids unnecessary moves and finishes runs when it's time.
Good hands and great post-catch wiggle create added value for offenses.

Shifty athlete with outstanding run balance and vision … skillfully presses the hole and sets up defenders with subtle juke steps, forcing tacklers to diveat ankles (credits Texas RB coach Tashard Choice for developing his elusiveness, especially at the second level) … instantly changes gaps (and frustrates linebackers)with his explosive jump cuts … able to breeze through arm tackles with his initial acceleration through holes and in/out of his cuts … sticky hands as a receiver withthe body control and catch radius to pull in off-target throws … dangerous target in the flat with his ability to make the first man miss … blocks with the awarenessand toughness needed for pass pro … only one fumble in college … described as a “genuine” person by his teammates and as an “invaluable” leader by head coachSteve Sarkisian; had such an impact that Sarkisian sent him on the field for the final snap (victory formation) of the 2023 Big 12 Championship Game (just weeks postACL surgery) … averaged north of 6.0 yards per carry in each of his three seasons in Austin.
Impressive burst for a big back ; Second gear ; Accelerates downfield ; Three-down starter ability ; Strong build ; Natural running instincts ; Patient; Quick feet ; Nose for the end zone ; Another gear to hit the second level ; Gets yards after contact ; Good body lean to run low ; Bends at the knee ; Runs behind his pads ; Can create for himself ; Good vision ; Keeps feet going after contact ; Has upside for passing game 
Suffered torn ACL in November that ended his season.
Still learning to press the hole and set up blockers on zone runs.
Needs to run with more pace in choosing his lanes against pro speed.
Power into and through contact is just average.
Will need to square up rushers and limit lead-shoulder block approach.

Tall, well-defined body type but leaner than ideal with inconsistent power and pad level … guilty of making too many moves in the backfi eld when theread calls for him to get downhill in short yardage … shows patience on one play, not enough the next … bl ocking skill set is promising, but he prefers to slam hisshoulder into blitzers instead of setting up shop and using his hands … saw just 46 snaps on special teams … medical evaluation will be important after he suffered atorn ACL in his right knee (November 2023), which required surgery and sidelined him for the remainder of the season and the draft process; also battled injury as asophomore and had bilateral hernia surgery the day after the bowl game (December 2022), which sidelined him for most of 2023 spring practices … only threequarters of a season’s worth of starting production.

Jaylen Wright,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaylen-wright/32005752-4939-8099-f6ee-7772cc125a42,"Explosive back with good size and breakaway speed. Wright’s running style is more linear than free-flowing, which limits his cut smoothness and elusiveness on the second level. His vision and aggression as an interior runner are just average, but that won’t stop him from putting yards on the stat sheet. He regularly bounced runs wide and beat the pursuit around the corner, so a move to a stretch-based running attack would be a natural fit, allowing his speed to shine. He’s capable of running with power, but he will default into finesse at times. Wright’s big-play potential and talent as a pass catcher should make him a Day 2 target as a future starter.
A one-year starter, Wright was the lead back in head coach Josh Heupel’s version of the Air Raid spread scheme. He led the Volunteers in rushing each ofthe last two seasons and finished No. 1 among all FBS running backs in yards per carry in 2023 (7.39). Wright, who formerly was roommates with speedster widereceiver Jalin Hyatt, is a good-sized back with the foot quickness and speed bursts that leads to explosive plays (25.74 percent of his carries in 2023 went for 10-plusyards, No. 1 in the FBS). Though his pace and patience must improve for more controlled runs, he showed a lot of promise with his receiving skills and pass-pro repson his 2023 film. Overall, Wright needs to develop a better feel for using tempo to maximize what is there, but his run strength, balance and ability to cut/weaveat top speed make him dangerous with the ball in his hands. He projects as a scheme-versatile back (stylistically similar to Jerome Ford) who can handle work onall three downs.","
Sprinter’s speed for long touchdown runs once he hits the open field.
Posted an explosive run (10-plus yards) on 25.4 percent of his carries in 2023.
Sudden jump-cut creates lateral exits away from tacklers.
Linear runner but can get to change of direction with timing.
Displayed ability to stay up and drag tacklers against Texas A&M.
Natural, sticky hands with potential to run more routes than he did in college.

Muscular build with defined arms and quads … gives his blockers a chance to do their jobs before using his burst to accelerat e through holes … has trackspeed, but his ability to cut away from pursuit angles at full speed and create missed tackles is more impressive … most of his explosives came on the outside, wherehe could bounce and find a runway (three carries of 50-plus yards in 2023) … keeps his shoulders square and his feet underneath him for quick lateral cuts … runswith balance and run strength, and he averaged 4.35 yards after contact in 2023 (third best in the FBS among backs with 130-plus carries) … willing to step up andstone linebackers in pass pro … only 30 career catches, but he caught the ball well when targeted … plenty of tread left — fewer than 400 offensive touches in college… produced when given the opportunity, averaging 6.24 yards per carry over the last two seasons.","
Fumbled four times on 146 carries in 2022.
Doesn’t trust his eyes, creating indecisiveness as an inside runner.

Lacks efficiency of movement when stacking cuts.
Will need to play with more awareness when protecting the pocket.

Prefers to step/spin out of contact and doesn’t consistently drop his pads into contact or fall forward … inside vision is inconsistent and will leave somemeat on the bone … needs to be quicker adjusting his tempo to attack daylight as it opens … wide base helps his balance mid-cut but also hinders some of his lateralexplosiveness at times … anticipation in pass protection is still developing … fumbled five times over the last two seasons, although only once in 2023 … minimalspecial-teams experience and wasn’t used as a returner in college … scored just four times in 2023 … wasn’t asked to carry the offense (12 or fewer offensive touchesin half of his games in 2023) … underwent a procedure on his left thumb after the 2023 season.",TENNESSEE,116,RB,Miami Dolphins,2024,"Explosive back with good size and breakaway speed.

Trey Benson,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trey-benson/32004245-4e64-9191-567b-28b29177bf93,"Big back who might need to table his desires to be an elusive runner and adopt a more physical, decisive approach as a pro. Benson had just two seasons of collegiate wear and tear, but he only hit the 20-carry mark in one game. He runs with good knee-bend, agility and contact balance but takes too long to process the front and hit holes between the tackles. He has creative athleticism but lacks creative vision, so he would be wise to keep more runs on track and finish with consistent authority rather than searching for greener grass. Benson has some talent as a pass catcher and enough protection ability to warrant a role as a complementary three-down option.
A two-year starter at Florida State, Benson was the lead back in head coach Mike Norvell’s up-tempo offense with mostly gap-scheme runs. After twoseasons (and a major injury) at Oregon, he was consistently productive the past two seasons in Tallahassee, averaging 6.1 yards per carry over his Seminoles’ career.He also scored three touchdowns of 80-plus yards (in three different ways). Benson, who models his game after Adrian Peterson, runs with the plant-and-goexplosiveness and run strength to rarely go down on initial contact and forces some missed tackles that defy gravity. Because the Florida State offense wascommitted to its package for backup running back Lawrance Toafili, Benson averaged just 13.5 offensive touches per game in 2023, but he showed key improvementsas both a pass catcher and blocker. Overall, Benson’s vision and run instincts tend to be spotty, but he runs hard off tackle with the burst and balance to stay afloatthrough contact. Cut in the Melvin Gordon mold, he projects best as part of an NFL committee, in which he’d have any-down and big-play potential.","

MarShawn Lloyd,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marshawn-lloyd/32004c4c-4f67-3464-78d4-33609054aa9a,"Lloyd's flashes on tape could lead a team to envision a more expansive role for him in its offense, but based on his play, he feels more like a good complementary option with big-play potential. Frankly, some of his South Carolina tape from 2022 felt more exciting than his 2023 USC film, despite the higher yardage-per-carry mark in 2023. While he ran with improved patience and set up blockers more diligently in '23, he ran with a greater sense of urgency the year prior and proved he could create explosive plays without as much help from his offensive line. Lloyd runs with slightly below-average vision but has the juice to play the role of ""chunk-play slasher"" and dangerous open-field pass catcher. Lloyd is a low-mileage prospect, and the scope of his role will obviously depend on scheme fit.
A one-year starter at USC, Lloyd was the top back on the depth chart in head coach Lincoln Riley’s RPO, spread (multiple-run) scheme. After three yearsat South Carolina, he transferred to the Trojans and had a productive 2023 season (led the team in rushing in 11 of 12 regular-season games), finishing as one of onlyfive FBS running backs to average more than 7.0 yards per carry. With his vision and dynamic cutting skills, Lloyd is a shift y runner with the short-area explosion andlateral agility to leave defenders diving at air (20.87 percent of his carries resulted in a 10-plus-yard gain). He frequently springs free because of the creativity heshows with the ball in his hands, although he relies too much on his east-west options and needs to be more consistent finishing runs. Overall, Lloyd doesn’t have theprofile of a high-volume back, but he can spark an NFL offense with his mix of patience, burst and promise as a pass catcher.

Frankly, some of his South Carolina tape from 2022 felt more exciting than his 2023 USC film, despite the higher yardage-per-carry mark in 2023. While he ran with improved patience and set up blockers more diligently in '23, he ran with a greater sense of urgency the year prior and proved he could create explosive plays without as much help from his offensive line.

Tyrone Tracy Jr.,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tyrone-tracy-jr/32005452-4111-6277-e892-3ab02612e4c2,"Tracy was a full-time running back for only one year but had exciting flashes all over his tape. He’s a bendy, rhythmic runner who sees and traverses the interior run lanes like he built the maze. He creates additional yardage with a blend of elusiveness, power and a willful desire to maximize each run, but he will need to curb his eagerness to bounce runs wide when it’s time to finish and move to the next snap. While he’s still honing his skills as a runner, his ability to handle gadget runs and threaten linebackers out of the backfield could get him on the field early on. Tracy will be an older rookie, but his versatility and burgeoning talent as a complementary runner should open evaluators’ eyes to what he could become as a pro.
A two-year starter at Purdue, Tracy played a “WideBack” position in offensive coordinator Graham Harrell’s scheme, which utilized h is skills as both arunning back and wide receiver. After four seasons as a receiver at Iowa, his versatility as ball carrie r blossomed in West Lafayette, and in 2023 he led the Big Ten inrushing yards per carry (6.34). Displaying natural instincts with the ball in his hands, Tracy runs with the dynamic agility and elusiveness to slip tackles from differentangles (21.9 percent of his carries in 2023 resulted in a 10-plus-yard run, which ranked top five in the FBS). However, his inexperience at running back shows in hissporadic tendencies when choosing run lanes. Overall, Tracy needs to improve his decision-making at the line of scrimmage, but he can create with his quick lateralcuts and contact balance — and he can stay on the field on passing downs. He is a multi-dimensional threat as a rusher, receiver and special teamer, whichincreases his chances of commanding an NFL roster spot.","

Ray Davis,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ray-davis/32004441-5663-2804-a8ce-2174ee79562e,"Three-down back with adequate blend of toughness between the tackles and production out of the backfield. Davis can be a tad indecisive at times but did a much better job of toggling between urgent and patient in his lone season at Kentucky. The vision is fairly average, and he's not going to scare NFL defenses with his speed, but he does alter his pacing to create openings, and he'll finish with some thud behind his pads. Ultimately, he'll need to step up his pass protection to be trusted as a third-down option. Davis' compact frame, toughness and ability to catch the football could make him a middle-round option as a three-down backup with the ability to play a larger role in time.
A one-year starter at Kentucky, Davis was the main offensive weapon in offensive coordinator Liam Coen’s gap-focused scheme. His journey is worthy ofa Hollywood script, but he is much more than just a feel-good story and played his best football in 2023, becoming the first college football player ever to rush for1,000-plus yards at three different FBS programs (Temple, Vanderbilt, Kentucky). With his quick reads and lateral agility, Davis wi ll juke defenders out of their cleatsusing dynamic plant-and-go cuts (his performance against Florida in 2023 might be the best running back tape in this class). Though he needs to remedy his issues inpass protection, he is a dependable pass catcher and recorded at least one reception in all 25 games he played the past two seasons. Overall, Davis has racked up alot of miles and lacks explosive long speed, but his vision, cutting skills and competitive toughness are translatable traits. Although he doesn’t offer much onspecial teams, he can be a productive rotational back for an NFL offense.","
Runs behind his pads, falling forward after delivering a blow.
Ran with much better patience behind lead blockers in 2023.
Florida game looked like teaching tape, with 280 rush yards and three TDs.
Uses slow-and-go pacing to distract the edge and open the corner.
Catches with soft hands and has ability to shake or break tackles.

Short with a muscular, athletic build … uses his change-of-direction skills to make abrupt lateral cuts away from tackling angles … quick, controlled feetat the line to cut back or accelerate through holes with urgency … has the vision to play a few moves ahead and string cuts together at all three levels (12 runs of 20-plus yards in 2023) … will drops his pads and attack contact with balance and authority … displays natural receiving traits with quick eyes/hands to handle fastballs …seven receiving touchdowns in 2023 led Kentucky and ranked No. 1 among all FBS running backs … fumbled only twice over his three seasons in the SEC … remarkablestory of determination and overcoming adverse circumstance while staying positive (NFL scout: “He chose betterness over bitterness. Talk about being dealt a roughhand. He overcame and did it with a smile.”) … set the Kentucky single -season record with 21 total touchdowns, which ranked No. 3 in the FBS.

Hip tightness slows ability to gather and cut on outside runs.
Unsure eyes cause small foot-stutters before hitting the gas.
Lacks desired flow speed to widen the defense to the boundary.
Very average vision as an interior runner.
More reactive than proactive on the second level.

Lacks ideal top-end speed and doesn’t have a pull-away gear … instinctive first move is to work laterally, which will get him in trouble versus NFLdefenses … always in attack mode, but he could use more patience to allow blocks/lanes to develop … below-average setup, technique and sustain as a pass blocker(see his 2023 South Carolina tape) … missed the final nine games of his junior season at Vanderbilt after tearing a ligament in his toe (September 2021), whichrequired surgery … doesn’t offer any value on special teams, either as a returner or on coverages … will turn 25 during his rookie season … accumulated 840 offensivetouches in his college career and faces wear-and-tear questions.

Will Shipley,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/will-shipley/32005348-4938-6967-5869-f740d03ae02a,"Versatile running back with talent as a runner, receiver and kick returner. Shipley possesses early speed, allowing him to whip through creases and outrun linebackers to the corner. He’s a flexible runner who reads up to the linebackers and curates his runs with a feel for both defensive positioning and run lane development. He can balance through contact but is unlikely to move NFL piles. Shipley does a nice job of setting up opponents from anywhere on the field and has the agility to hop and hurdle over bodies. He’s not a workhorse and still has work to do in order to solidify himself as a third-down option, but the athletic talent and skill level could create an early pathway into a spot as a productive RB2.
A three-year starter at Clemson, Shipley was a versatile running back in offensive coordinator Garrett Riley’s balanced scheme. A former five-star recruit,he couldn’t match his breakout sophomore season as a junior because of injuries, but he was consistently productive as a runner and receiver (only ACC player with2,700-plus combined rushing yards over the last three seasons). Shipley reads the field well and runs with short-area quickness in and out of his cuts — he credits hislacrosse background for his skilled footwork and gear change. He is at his best in the screen game, where his vision and contact balance have a chanc e to shine.Overall, Shipley has only average size, but he runs with controlled athleticism and competitive urgency in all areas of his game. Though he has the mentality of anearly-down grinder, his versatile skills fit best in a third-down role and on special teams.","

Blake Corum,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/blake-corum/3200434f-5278-3995-2ab1-10c11dc750f2,"Compact runner with average size, outstanding contact balance and a rare talent for finding and fitting into small crevices for short-yardage conversions and touchdowns. Corum is a bit of a one-speed runner lacking sizzle and wiggle but gets it downhill with timing and finishes runs with good forward lean. He has the hard-hat mentality to handle heavy workloads and can exploit defenses that fatigue or miss their run fits. The talent doesn't stand out on its own, but he's strong, competitive and team-oriented with exceptional football character. He can catch it when needed and is above average in picking up the blitz, which could earn him status as a three-down backup with a chance to find early carries as an RB2/3.
A two-year starter at Michigan, Corum was the lead back in offensive coordinator Sherrone Moore’s gap/zone scheme. After becoming the Wolverines’starter in 2022, he established himself as the straw that stirred the offensive drink and led the FBS in rushing touchdowns (27) in 2023 — accounting for at least onetouchdown run in all 26 games he played the last two seasons. Jim Harbaugh puts Corum in the same conversation as Frank Gore as the best running backs he evercoached. (Harbaugh: “There’s no doubt that Blake will be right on the same dance floor as Gore in every way as a player.”) With the instinctive way he pairs his eyesand feet, Corum has terrific vision and an energetic lower body to read and maximize the blocking in front of him, scrapping for every yard. He wasn’t a high-volumereceiving target in college and must continue to improve his consistency as a pass blocker. Overall, Corum is smaller than ideal for his run style, but he makes quick,urgent decisions with the low center of gravity and burst to bounce runs or maneuver through congestion. His determination to maximize each carry will translatewell to an NFL offense, although his effectiveness on third downs will determine his upside.","
Exceptional production over the last two years.
Feels lane development and works toward the opening.
Hits the run north-south when it's time to go.
Absorbs second-level contact with impressive balance
Quick to process and sidestep early penetration.

Steps up and challenges linebackers in blitz pickup.

Makes quick decisions and expertly uses his blockers … agile athlete, and pairs his feet with his eyes on inside zone … not only finds the cutback lane butalso has the ankle flexion and foot gather for tight cuts without gearing down … compactly built with excellent lower-body strength … runs low to the ground with thecontact balance to bounce/spin off tacklers who don’t wrap up … finishes each run and won’t concede at contact … has a high batting average in short yardage (staysbehind his pads, finds a hint of space and drives his powerful legs) … responsible for 24 runs of 20-plus yards over the last two seasons … has some kick-returnexperience (18/400/0) … maniacal worker, and the coaches forced him to rest and develop more moderation to his workout routines (former Michigan RB coachMike Hart: “He wants to be great, and nothing will slow him down from doing that.) … named a 2023 team captain (Charlotte head coach Bigg Poggi, who coachedCorum in high school and at Michigan: “You coach your whole life and probably will never have a guy like this.”) … rushed for a touchdown in all 26 games his juniorand senior seasons (not counting the 2022 Ohio State game, in which he played only four snaps) … visited the end zone so much he bought property there, setting theMichigan records for rushing touchdowns in a season (27) and career (58).

Just 12 of his last 45 rush touchdowns went for more than 5 yards.
Creativity on the second level is just average.
Slow to reignite acceleration when gathering and slowing feet.
Gets impatient and will rush block development.
Wears down defenses with volume rather than power.

Rocked-up musculature, but his overall frame is smaller than desired … aggressively presses the action but plays too fast at times and could use morepatience to allow lanes to present themselves … don’t expect him to be a push-the-pile runner in the NFL … dump-off screen option, but he wasn’t asked to run thefull running-back route tree … really short arms, which show up in pass protection … overeager as a pass blocker, often leaving his feet t oo early … only five careerfumbles — but three came in 2023 … suffered a torn meniscus, sprained MCL and “severe” bone bruise in his left knee (November 2022), which forced him to missthat season’s final two games.

Rocked-up musculature, but his overall frame is smaller than desired … aggressively presses the action but plays too fast at times and could use morepatience to allow lanes to present themselves … don’t expect him to be a push-the-pile runner in the NFL … dump-off screen option, but he wasn’t asked to run thefull running-back route tree … really short arms, which show up in pass protection … overeager as a pass blocker, often leaving his feet t oo early … only five careerfumbles — but three came in 2023 … suffered a torn meniscus, sprained MCL and “severe” bone bruise in his left knee (November 2022), which forced him to missthat season’s final two games.

Impressive blend of size, agility and toughness.

Subtle lateral shifts to bounce around bodies through first two levels.
Drops his pads and plows through early arm tacklers.

Effective pass catcher able to rescue throws off back hip.

Braelon Allen,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/braelon-allen/3200414c-4c06-3734-6e11-4c57194f79b4,"Allen's splashy entry into college football had evaluators excited about what the end product might look like, but now there are more questions than answers. Allen has rare size on an imposing frame, and his production is nothing to scoff at. Evaluators will need to rely more heavily on his 2022 tape, where he ran with better decisiveness and instincts in a pro-style running attack. He's built to be a banger but needs to embrace a consistently physical style, as he lacks the footwork and hips to elude defenders with finesse. Allen will compete for a role as a two-down backup but could bolster his chances for success if he plays at a lighter weight, to improve his quickness.
: A three-year starter at Wisconsin, Allen was the focal point of offensive coordinator Phil Longo’s multiple-run scheme. After signing as a safety/linebackerout of high school (at age 16), he stayed on offense and led the Badgers in rushing each of his three seasons in Madison, including 20 career 100-yard rushing games,the most of any active college player in 2023. (Wisconsin was 18-2 in those games). A balanced, one-cut athlete, Allen shows a great feel for lane development,especially on inside/outside zone. He can run with either finesse or physicality, depending on the situation (69.5 percent of his yardage came after contact in 2023).He needs to prove his reliability (ball security, durability), but he plays through pain, and NFL teams love that he is the youngest player in this draft class. Overall,Allen isn’t overly creative and doesn’t run with as much nastiness as his size suggests, but he is well built with the vision, feet and overall feel to maximize the rundesign. He has the talent and third-down potential to be a productive NFL tandem back, similar to Tyler Allgeier. ","
Enormous runner with overbearing, athletic build and impressive production.
In 2021 and 2022, showed he could trust his eyes and run with more decisiveness than he did in 2023.
Can play bumper cars with tacklers in space to add up yards after contact.
Has build-up speed in the open field and throws his stiff-arm like a boxer's jab.
Instinctive in short yardage, with high success rate on short-yardage carries.
Good understanding of protection duties and has size to square and stop the blitz.

Well-built, big-bodied runner … not a battering ram but can be physical when he wants to be … above -average vision and patience at the line ofscrimmage and keeps his feet tied to his eyes … anticipates block/lane development to stay on schedule … able to quickly plant and make sharp lateral cutbacks … nota burner but paces his strides well … target share increased each season … shows coordinated body adjustments as a pass catch er to make turning grabs withoutlosing focus (one drop on 30 targets in 2023) … excellent awareness and body for blocking duties … dedicated to the weight room and was squatting 515 pounds andhang-cleaning 405 pounds as a high school sophomore … strong character reviews and described as “ultra-competitive” by former head coach Paul Chryst (NFL scout:“Rare maturity for his age. Plus, he’s a homebody. He’s all football, all the time.”) … youngest player in the draft class and will be 20 for his entire rookie season …averaged 5.9 yards per carry over his career and finished No. 9 in school history in rushing yards (3,494).
Physical downhill runner ; Power to run through tackles ; Thick build ; Tough to tackle ; Contact balance ; Picks up yards after contact ; Strong lower body ; Short-yardage, goal-line asset ; Keeps feet going after contact ; Can move the pile ; Acceleration to the second level ; Willing blocker ; Has the size to pass protect ; Can contribute on swing passes","
Below-average burst to race through the line of scrimmage.
Tight-hipped with lethargic change of direction in tight spaces.
Would like to see more ferocity finishing runs to send messages.
Slow to accelerate after a cut and lacks general escapability.
Carries the football away from his body, leading to fumbles

Average hole burst and speed to the outside … late to set up his moves and doesn’t consistently make defenders miss one on one … hip tightnessrestricts quick changes of direction … builds his speed quickly for chunk gains but won’t be able to run away from NFL speed … once his feet are slowed, he requires amoment to get going again … was more of a dump-off receiving option and needs to develop his route tree … one of the better pass-blocking backs in this class butcan do a better job sinking and finishing … ball security was an issue in college (nine career fumbles, including four in 2023) … missed time to injury each season— satout one game as a freshman because of a concussion (September 2021); battled through shoulder and right leg injuries as a sop homore, missing one game(November 2022); plagued by a left ankle injury late in his junior season (November 2023), missing on e game.

Bucky Irving,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bucky-irving/32004952-5673-1762-cc21-a0207d2553dd,"Compact and willful, Irving is deeply committed to each run his play-caller trusts him with. He punches above his weight class with excellent contact balance and leg drive to fight through tackles and squeeze every yard out of the run. However, Irving showed a concerning lack of explosiveness at the NFL Scouting Combine. He is frequently in a rush and would rather run through a wall than around it but he does have the agility to make tacklers miss with wide, lateral cuts when he runs with better patience. Irving isn’t ready for NFL protection duties and is a little tight as a route runner, but he catches the ball cleanly. Irving is missing ideal size and explosiveness, which could land him somewhere in the middle rounds of the draft as an average backup.
: A two-year starter at Oregon, Irving was the lead back in offensive coordinator Will Stein’s zone -read, balanced run attack. After leaving Minnesotafollowing one season for more offensive touches, he surpassed 1,000 yards rushing in each of his two seasons in Eugene and led all FBS running backs in catches (56)in 2023. With his vision, darting quickness and wiggle in the hole, Irving routinely finds yards that aren’t blocked for him. Al though he will have a tougher timechurning out yards after contact in the NFL, his body balance and low center of gravity are assets — especially out in space. Overall, Irving is undersized andunderpowered, but he has pass-catching skills and instinctive run qualities to quickly sort and make sharp directional cuts to daylight. He projects as an NFLcomplementary back who can be a productive changeup in a committee (like former North Carolina RB Michael Carter).","

Undersized ; Lacks height ; Gets knocked back when defenders hit him square ; Has limitations in blitz protection",OREGON,121,RB,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,2024,"Compact and willful, Irving is deeply committed to each run his play-caller trusts him with. He punches above his weight class with excellent contact balance and leg drive to fight through tackles and squeeze every yard out of the run. However, Irving showed a concerning lack of explosiveness at the NFL Scouting Combine. He is frequently in a rush and would rather run through a wall than around it but he does have the agility to make tacklers miss with wide, lateral cuts when he runs with better patience. Irving isn’t ready for NFL protection duties and is a little tight as a route runner, but he catches the ball cleanly. Irving is missing ideal size and explosiveness, which could land him somewhere in the middle rounds of the draft as an average backup.
: A two-year starter at Oregon, Irving was the lead back in offensive coordinator Will Stein’s zone -read, balanced run attack. After leaving Minnesotafollowing one season for more offensive touches, he surpassed 1,000 yards rushing in each of his two seasons in Eugene and led all FBS running backs in catches (56)in 2023. With his vision, darting quickness and wiggle in the hole, Irving routinely finds yards that aren’t blocked for him. Al though he will have a tougher timechurning out yards after contact in the NFL, his body balance and low center of gravity are assets — especially out in space. Overall, Irving is undersized andunderpowered, but he has pass-catching skills and instinctive run qualities to quickly sort and make sharp directional cuts to daylight. He projects as an NFLcomplementary back who can be a productive changeup in a committee (like former North Carolina RB Michael Carter).

Ashton Jeanty,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ashton-jeanty/32004a45-4142-7291-3a65-da29eaedce27,"Jeanty plays a position that has become devalued on draft day, but his unique talent and the resurgence of the run game in the NFL should force teams to reconsider that factor when weighing his value. He’s the ultimate yardage creator, with the talent and skill set to succeed independent of the quality of his blocking. Jeanty’s speed forces linebackers to flow hard outside, creating cutback lanes and chunk runs, while his vision, balance and elusiveness get it done along the interior. The threat of what he can do on the ground should create ideal play-action opportunities for his team, allowing his next play-caller to, say, unburden a young quarterback or any other passer being asked to shoulder too much of the offense. He’s compact and muscular, but there could be some minor concern surrounding his massive workload in 2024. This top-flight running back is capable of becoming the face of an offense in a league where the pendulum might be swinging back to the running game. Jeanty has future All-Pro talent.
 A two-year starter at Boise State, Jeanty was the featured weapon in ofensive coordinator Dirk Koetter's multiple (gap and zone) runscheme. After putting first round-level play on his 2023 tape, he had one of the best running back seasons in college football history in 2024,joining Barry Sanders as the only FBS players to eclipse 2,600 rushing yards in a season. Jeanty finished as the Heisman Trophy runner-up.THE BEAST | BACK TO TABLE OF CONTENTS 32With his low center of gravity and explosiveness, Jeanty has an uncanny ability to stay afloat through contact and be elusive in space (led FBS with151 forced missed tackles in 2024 — 57 more than No. 2 on the list). He trusts his vision when following his blocks, but instead of predetermininghis path, he displays outstanding reactionary reads to sort, cut and create (responsible for 12 carries of 50 yards or more in 2024; no other FBSplayer had more than five). Overall, Jeanty displays exceptional contact balance, run instincts and versatility in the passing game, reminiscentof LaDainian Tomlinson. He has the talent to emerge as a high-level running back early in his NFL career.","
Runs low to the ground with a wide base, fast feet and good vision.
Trusts play design and won’t come off the track without reason.
Picks up momentum and danger with every step he takes.
Instant burst limits time for defenders to read and react.
Creates yardage with a rare trio of wiggle, power and speed.
Rockets past contain, around the corner and into space.
Had runs of 50-plus yards in nine of his 14 games in 2024.
Thwarts tacklers and re-ignites the run with contact balance and leg drive.
Taps the gas and skips past tacklers in short spaces when needed.
Plays fast and maintains his pace through cuts and change of direction.
Consistently creates magic with cutbacks as a zone runner.

TreVeyon Henderson,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/treveyon-henderson/32004845-4e14-4466-e552-da8f305c6946,"Henderson is capable of starring on third downs or biting off a bigger chunk as a three-down option. He has average size but above-average juice with good acceleration. He’s an average decision-maker inside and is not overly creative once confronted by the defense, but he has the pacing and subtle shiftiness to excel as an outside runner. He might be the best pass-protecting running back in this draft and is more than capable as a pass-catcher. Henderson isn’t Jahmyr Gibbs, but he can operate in a similar role for teams looking to add a more dynamic player to their running back room.
A four-year starter at Ohio State, Henderson shared running back duties in ofensive coordinator Chip Kelly's diverse run game(gap/zone, pin-pulls, counters, etc.). After setting Ohio State records as a freshman, he battled injuries the next two seasons, then willingly splitcarries as a senior. That shift hurt his overall stats but kept him fresh (7.1 yards per carry in 2024). Nonetheless, he still finished top five in schoolhistory in rushing yards and No. 3 in total touchdowns (48). Although his inside vision can get a little messy at times, and he isn't the most graceful working through tight spaces, Henderson can bouncelaterally and smash the accelerator to sprint through voids or convert his speed to power as a finisher. As a blocker, he delivers thunderbolts intohis target. As a pass catcher, he secures grabs away from his frame and has dynamic ability on option routes. Overall, Henderson isn't a provenbellcow between the tackles, but his bursts of speed make him a home-run threat and coaches can trust him to execute without the football.His versatile skill set will be an immediate upgrade to an NFL backfield.","
Reads both levels on stretch plays and presses runs tight to blocker's hip.
Slides from gap to gap with twitchy lateral movements.
Accelerates into build-up speed that makes him tough to catch.
Rhythmic in and out of cuts and hasn’t fumbled in three years.
Shakes off angle tackles and drops pads to deliver big contact at the finish.
Sorts, centers and strikes like an offensive lineman in protection.
Displayed route-running potential against Purdue in 2024.
Soft hands make him a safety valve out of the backfield for quarterbacks.

Compactly built with sculpted muscle tone in upper and lower halves. Instant acceleration to fly through holes or outrace pursuit on outside zone. Has wiggle to plant, bounce laterally and throw off pursuit with quick lane shifts (also has a killer spin move). Consistently stays behind his pads to pinball off contact and finish forward. Slams it hard inside and grinds out tough yards with low pads. Follows blocks well on CG/GH counter runs. 22.1 percent of carries in 2024 resulted in gains of 10 yards or more (third best in the FBS). Fumbled only twice in four years (zero times in past two seasons); Ohio State recovered both. Outstanding pass catcher, using his tracking/plucking skills (two drops on 53 combined targets in 2023-24). Easily uncovers when lined up man-to-man with linebackers in space (career 11.1 yards per catch average). Trusted blocker — consistently puts defenders on their backsides with his pop as a lead blocker and in pass pro. Credits faith for his maturation; motivated by his mother (used his NIL money to help her retire). Unselfish teammate and voted a 2024 team captain — he told Ryan Day to do ""what is best for the team"" when Ohio State was considering adding RB Quinshon Judkins in the transfer portal. Finished fifth on Ohio State's all-time rushing yards list (seven yards behind Eddie George).","
Slightly undersized to take on a heavier workload.
Plays fast but is primarily a one-speed runner.
Average vision inside will lead him into trafficked areas.
Not much creativity to conjure yardage in tighter spaces.
Catches too much contact through the line of scrimmage.

Slightly tight-hipped and pads stay aligned with his hips/legs. Patience and tempo run hot/cold at times. At his best when led to the hole, instead of trying to reset/adjust his vision versus sudden traffic. Drive-killing penalty on 2024 Texas tape for punching a defender after a play. Battled sleep paralysis growing up and during his tenure at Ohio State. Workload questions after battling several injuries: missed five games (and parts of several others) as a sophomore because of a broken sesamoid bone in left foot (Sept. 2022), which hampered him all season (surgery in Dec. 2022); missed three games as a junior (Oct. 2023) because of injury.",OHIO STATE,38,RB,New England Patriots,2025,"Henderson is capable of starring on third downs or biting off a bigger chunk as a three-down option.

Omarion Hampton,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/omarion-hampton/32004841-4d77-3946-bc04-1f7201601885,"High-volume battering ram with a three-ingredient recipe of size, strength and aggression. 
Hampton is a linear runner lacking creativity and wiggle, but once the gas is engaged, he runs like a downhill truck whose brake lines have been cut. He has the base, balance and power to batter tacklers and reignite runs after contact but he fails to recognize alternative run lanes that offer easier paths and more yardage. He needs to work on his pass protection but can create positive plays on swing passes and screens. Hampton is a tone-setting future starter who can handle a heavy workload, but he absorbs rare levels of heavy contact that could create durability or longevity issues if he doesn’t learn to pick and choose his battles.","
Big back with an impressive, chiseled physique.
Access to a sudden lateral jump-cut to elude penetration.
Displays adequate burst as an off-tackle runner.
Has the hips and feet to stack downhill moves.
Runs square and drives through tacklers with good contact balance.
Willful with the ability to go get must-have yards with force.
Requires gang tackling to keep an ember from relighting.
Capable option on swing passes and screens.

A two-year starter at North Carolina, Hampton was the featured back in former offensive coordinator Chip Lindsey's balanced run attack. He was a beast during the 2023 season and led the ACC in rushing, but it was even more impressive to see him repeat as the conference'sleading rusher in 2024 without Drake Maye (and with defenses selling out to stop the run). He rushed for 100 or more yards in 10 of 12 games in2024 and set a UNC single-season record with 2,033 all-purpose yards.With his NFL-ready frame, Hampton quickly reads the blocking scheme and collects his feet to accelerate through congestion or press and cuttoward slivers of daylight. Once he gets north-south, he will mash the gas pedal into second-level defenders, but sometimes does so at theexpense of his balance, and those heavy hits will take their toll over time. Overall, Hampton has only average creativity and is a tad tight in his hips and ankles, but he is a bruising runner with an effective blend of patience, power, and speed. Given his reliability on passing downs, he is a complete player and should start as an NFL rookie.
Thick, squared-up build. Above-average run strength, especially in his lower half (broke his high school's squat record as a sophomore). Tilts field downhill with the forward lean to barrel through half-tackles. Above-average initial burst for a 220-pound athlete. Reads blocks well at line of scrimmage to press hips of his blockers. Subtly sets up defenders before cutting back against pursuit's leverage, creating fly-by tackle attempts. Accelerates cleanly off plant foot to transfer speed in/out of cuts. Feasted on pivot routes (two drops on 80 career targets). Transfers ball to correct hand to protect against fumbles (one in 2024). Proven as durable workhorse (25 or more touches in eight of 12 games in 2024). Offers both talent and experience in pass protection. Finished career No. 4 in school history in rushing yards (3,565), No. 3 in rushing touchdowns (36), and No. 2 in 10-yard runs.","
One-speed, long-strider runner with limited one-cut ability.
Slow vision to diagnose lane development and change run tracks.
Bangs into blockers and lacks adequate elusiveness.
Too eager to leave his feet and take abuse in the air.
Below-average speed to win wide and turn the corner.

Lack of swivel in hips creates tightness in turns, which limits open-field creativity. Sluggish getting through some lateral jump cuts. Will make himself too big of a target through line of scrimmage. Pad level needs better consistency to maintain his balance versus NFL defenders. Willing to power into contact, but not always through it. Stayed healthy in college but missed most of junior season in high school with broken left ankle (March 2021).",NORTH CAROLINA,22,RB,Los Angeles Chargers,2025,"High-volume battering ram with a three-ingredient recipe of size, strength and aggression. 
Hampton is a linear runner lacking creativity and wiggle, but once the gas is engaged, he runs like a downhill truck whose brake lines have been cut. He has the base, balance and power to batter tacklers and reignite runs after contact but he fails to recognize alternative run lanes that offer easier paths and more yardage. He needs to work on his pass protection but can create positive plays on swing passes and screens. Hampton is a tone-setting future starter who can handle a heavy workload, but he absorbs rare levels of heavy contact that could create durability or longevity issues if he doesn’t learn to pick and choose his battles. 
Big back with an impressive, chiseled physique.
Access to a sudden lateral jump-cut to elude penetration.
Displays adequate burst as an off-tackle runner.
Has the hips and feet to stack downhill moves.
Runs square and drives through tacklers with good contact balance.
Willful with the ability to go get must-have yards with force.
Requires gang tackling to keep an ember from relighting.
Capable option on swing passes and screens.

A two-year starter at North Carolina, Hampton was the featured back in former offensive coordinator Chip Lindsey's balanced run attack. He was a beast during the 2023 season and led the ACC in rushing, but it was even more impressive to see him repeat as the conference'sleading rusher in 2024 without Drake Maye (and with defenses selling out to stop the run). He rushed for 100 or more yards in 10 of 12 games in2024 and set a UNC single-season record with 2,033 all-purpose yards.With his NFL-ready frame, Hampton quickly reads the blocking scheme and collects his feet to accelerate through congestion or press and cuttoward slivers of daylight.

Dylan Sampson,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/dylan-sampson/32005341-4d33-8622-de8a-1e3d03b08479,"Compact back with good instincts and run-after-contact ability that propelled him to stardom in his lone season as a starter. Sampson separates himself from other backs in the class with an impressive feel for timing, spacing and blocking scheme. He sees lane development in real time and is disciplined to stay on the designed track, but he can flip a switch and improvise when traffic mounts. He can wiggle around tacklers or break free from their grasps. Ball security and pass protection improvement will be early priorities for his next coaching staff. Sampson plays with the instincts of a seasoned veteran and has the talent to build on what he started in 2024. 
A one-year starter at Tennessee, Sampson was a prolific runner in head coach Josh Heupel's up-tempo, multiple-run scheme(exclusively one-back sets in the gun). After serving as a backup behind Jaylen Wright and Jabari Small for two seasons, he emerged as SECOfensive Player of the Year in 2024 (averaged 131.4 rushing yards per game in SEC play), setting school-records for rushing yards (1,491) andrushing touchdowns (22) in a season.Although it looks chaotic at times when he plays in overdrive, Sampson runs with urgent speed getting through the first wave, and his sharp lateralcuts open up the field. He isn't powerful, but he runs with outstanding competitiveness and averaged a touchdown every 12.1 carries in college.Overall, Sampson is undersized by NFL standards and his inconsistent tempo gets him in trouble, but he is equal parts fast, physical andslippery as a runner and shows promise as a pass catcher. He can have a Tony Pollard-like impact for an NFL backfield.","
Good one-cut and jump-cut talent to get the run rolling.
Presses the line and cuts it tight off the blocker's hip.
Understands blocking scheme and feels run-lane development.
Instinctive inside runner with subtle cuts to avoid the heat.
Respects the run track but can bounce it wide if needed.
Excellent burst and speed to run outside or hit chunk plays.
Uses a “Madden spin” and lower-body power to shake off tacklers.
Efficient short-yardage back with a nose for the paint.

Loves to play fast and displays electricity with the ball in his hands. Can turn the corner and race down the sideline. Natural feel for following pullers on counter runs. Will press zone runs before using light feet to shake laterally (wears No. 6 because he models his game after Alvin Kamara). Accelerates into second-level contact with balance to spin out of defender's grasp. Makes sharp speed cuts and weaves to avoid getting squared up. Fights for every yard — and consistently gets more than expected. High-energy personality (Tennessee coach Josh Heupel: ""He's grown into somebody who has a great voice. He's truly a strong leader for us.""). Nose for the paint — scored 36 touchdowns in 35 games (set school record with at least one TD in 11 straight games). Carried Vols' offense in 2024, including breaking single-season rushing touchdown record that had stood for 95 years.","
Below-average size for workload asked of him.
Better vision on inside zone than as an outside runner.
Allowed defenders to rip the ball out of his hands.
Used infrequently as a pass catcher.
Uncertain when sifting through blitzes in protection.

Has some muscularity but frame is lighter than desired for the position. Not a powerful runner, inside or downhill. Adequate run patience as he searches for daylight but could use better anticipation to hit the hole as it comes open. Adequate hands as a receiver but will fight the ball at times (two drops on 25 targets in 2024). More than willing in pass pro but his hands and eyes need to improve to match up against NFL rushers. Extra fight as a runner gives defenders extra chances to swipe the ball (four fumbles in 2024). Didn't play on special teams in college and doesn't have return experience. Missed almost all of his final game against Ohio State with strained left hamstring (Dec. 2024).",TENNESSEE,120,RB,Cleveland Browns,2025,"Compact back with good instincts and run-after-contact ability that propelled him to stardom in his lone season as a starter.

Quinshon Judkins,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/quinshon-judkins/32004a55-4435-9919-355b-3e0aef2de56d,"Judkins is a productive runner possessing good size and great contact aggression. His running style is both urgent and a bit chaotic. He runs with good burst inside but is more collision-based than wiggle-oriented when maneuvering through the lane. He’s efficient on runs outside the tackle box, but he has a tough time outracing pursuit to create explosive runs. He is wired and built for a heavier carry count and short-yardage success, but the disparity in yards per carry between Judkins and TreVeyon Henderson, despite running behind the same line, is telling. Judkins might need to be paired with a slasher, but he has the ingredients needed to become a three-down RB1.
: A one-year starter at Ohio State, Judkins shared running back duties in former ofensive coordinator Chip Kelly's diverse run game(gap/zone, pin-pulls, counters, etc.). He had one of the best two-year rushing stretches in SEC history while at Ole Miss. He then transferred toColumbus, Ohio, for the 2024 season and surpassed 1,000 yards rushing for the third straight year. He joined Ohio State because he wanted to wina national title, and he helped pay of that goal with three touchdowns in a championship-game victory over Notre Dame.Judkins has quick eyes and footwork to react to the blocking geometry, although he often runs like he is starving and must balance his aggressivestyle with improved patience before attacking the line of scrimmage. His best traits are his play strength and the run toughness to drop his pads,barrel through heavy contact and come out the other side. Overall, Judkins isn't as dynamic as other backs in this class, but he is an ""attitude""runner with the quickness, vision and violence to be a productive lead option in an NFL backfield. He can help secure his spot on the depthchart by taking his passing-down responsibilities from serviceable to above average.","
Prototypical size, aggression and play strength.
Presses the run deep into the line before cutting.
Limits stride length when he looks for better control of his cut quickness.
Outside runs feature patience, decisiveness and efficiency in space.
Sudden burst to rush past arm traffic at the line of scrimmage.
Runs with NFL-caliber physicality and falls forward as a finisher.
Touchdown monster with a rushing score for every 16.4 carries over three seasons.
Has the dog in him for tough take-ons in blitz pickup.

Well-built, compact back with rocked-up quads. Displays both balance and run strength, making it a chore for defenders to get him on the ground. Won't slow into contact and never had a run he didn't finish. Has vision to find the crease or cutback. Good backfield feet with plant-and-go acceleration to build up immediate momentum. Aggressively attacks designed inside run lane with goal of hitting second level at top speed. Serviceable pass catcher and reliable in screen game. Terrific ball security for a back who seeks out contact (only one fumble in past two seasons). Finished with 50 career touchdowns and became the only player in Ole Miss history with 17 total touchdowns or more in a season (he did it twice). Above-average rushing production in both SEC and Big Ten (needed only two seasons to rank top three in all-time rushing yards at Ole Miss). Durable — didn't miss a game in past three seasons.","
Hips are too tight for sharp angles as a one-cut runner.
Lacks spatial awareness for smooth trips through the interior.
Below-average speed to outrace pursuit and stack explosive runs.
Averaged less than four yards per carry in five of nine conference games during the 2024 regular season.

More quick and decisive than truly explosive. Lacks getaway gear to speed away from pursuit in open field. Overeager at the line with inconsistent pace and patience. Needs to be choosier when picking lanes. Inconsistent in pass protection and struggles to stay square; stagnant feet and mistimed hand strikes. Didn't play on special teams in college. Plenty of mileage on the odometer (799 career touches in college, more than 500 touches in high school).",OHIO STATE,36,RB,Cleveland Browns,2025,"Judkins is a productive runner possessing good size and great contact aggression.

Bhayshul Tuten,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/bhayshul-tuten/32005455-5406-6215-da3b-cbf31441af43,"If you spend too much time focusing on the small inconsistencies of Tuten’s college game, you run the risk of overlooking the match he is for the pro game. He’s an explosive athlete with average size but a compact frame. He has elite straight-line speed and easy hips to make sudden cuts and turns. He’s fairly average at reading the front and running with early decisiveness but creates with wiggle, power and speed. Drops and fumbles are a concern, but runners with his contact balance, power and home run speed put tremendous stress on defenses over four quarters. Tuten could become a starting-caliber back with three-down value.
 A two-year starter at Virginia Tech, Tuten was a weapon in former ofensive coordinator Tyler Bowen's zone-based scheme. After hisbreakout sophomore season at North Carolina A&T, he transferred to Blacksburg and led the Hokies in rushing each of the past two seasons (6.3yards per carry in 2024). When the blocking gets a hat on a hat, Tuten has the explosiveness to do the rest and forces tacklers to be perfect withtheir technique to slow his leg churn (averaged 4.40 yards after contact per carry in 2024). He is much more comfortable running on the edgescompared to inside and needs to continue improving his decision-making between the tackles.A two-year starter at Virginia Tech, Tuten was a weapon in former ofensive coordinator Tyler Bowen's zone-based scheme.

He is much more comfortable running on the edgescompared to inside and needs to continue improving his decision-making between the tackles. Overall, Tuten is a balanced runner with the giddy-up burst to gash the defense when he finds the crease. His promise on third downs and experience as a kick returner increase the valuehe'd hold on an NFL roster.","
Rare track speed makes him a threat to go yard on any snap.
Good plant-and-cut wiggle to side step open-field tacklers.
Tough runner able to absorb contact and deliver punishment.
Powerful hips tear through arm and angle tackles on second level.
Can rocket around the corner and beat the pursuit angles by linebackers. 
Scrappy “square them up” mentality in pass protection.
Able to elude the first tackler and find the sticks on swing passes and leak-outs.
Big-play potential in a kick-return role.

""Freaks List"" alum — it shows on the tape and the stopwatch. Short but not small and carries decent mass on his frame. Quick-footed cuts to tilt turns while maintaining tempo. At his best on outside toss/pitch plays, where he can run on an outside track. Runs with natural balance to keep his feet churning through arm tackles. Will lower pads into contact to earn a few extra yards. Catches the ball well in screen game (zero drops in 2024). Averaged 23.8 yards per kick return in college, including two touchdowns (94-yarder, 99-yarder). Soft-spoken guy but flips a switch on the field.","
Ball security was an issue in both seasons at Virginia Tech.
Lacks decisiveness and feel for lane development. 
Would like to see him process and burst more quickly.
Will bounce a run wide instead of trusting and working behind a lead block.
Needs to learn to avoid the hellish contact and collisions he frequently takes on.
Has trouble securing passes that are outside of his frame.

Patience and vision will run hot and cold between the tackles. Want to see improvements anticipating in creating point of entry. Relies on east-west cuts; more likely to bounce than cut back inside. Ball security must improve (nine fumbles over two seasons with Hokies). Plays with energy in pass pro but technique isn't on same level, leading to breakdowns. Battled left ankle issue over final month of senior season (Nov. 2024).",VIRGINIA TECH,98,RB,Jacksonville Jaguars,2025,"If you spend too much time focusing on the small inconsistencies of Tuten’s college game, you run the risk of overlooking the match he is for the pro game.

He is much more comfortable running on the edgescompared to inside and needs to continue improving his decision-making between the tackles.A two-year starter at Virginia Tech, Tuten was a weapon in former ofensive coordinator Tyler Bowen's zone-based scheme. After his breakoutsophomore season at North Carolina A&T, he transferred to Blacksburg and led the Hokies in rushing each of the past two seasons (6.3 yards percarry in 2024). When the blocking gets a hat on a hat, Tuten has the explosiveness to do the rest and forces tacklers to be perfect with theirtechnique to slow his leg churn (averaged 4.40 yards after contact per carry in 2024). He is much more comfortable running on the edgescompared to inside and needs to continue improving his decision-making between the tackles. Overall, Tuten is a balanced runner with the giddy-up burst to gash the defense when he finds the crease. His promise on third downs and experience as a kick returner increase the valuehe'd hold on an NFL roster. 
Rare track speed makes him a threat to go yard on any snap.
Good plant-and-cut wiggle to side step open-field tacklers.
Tough runner able to absorb contact and deliver punishment.
Powerful hips tear through arm and angle tackles on second level.
Can rocket around the corner and beat the pursuit angles by linebackers. 
Scrappy “square them up” mentality in pass protection.
Able to elude the first tackler and find the sticks on swing passes and leak-outs.
Big-play potential in a kick-return role.

""Freaks List"" alum — it shows on the tape and the stopwatch. Short but not small and carries decent mass on his frame. Quick-footed cuts to tilt turns while maintaining tempo. At his best on outside toss/pitch plays, where he can run on an outside track. Runs with natural balance to keep his feet churning through arm tackles. Will lower pads into contact to earn a few extra yards. Catches the ball well in screen game (zero drops in 2024). Averaged 23.8 yards per kick return in college, including two touchdowns (94-yarder, 99-yarder). Soft-spoken guy but flips a switch on the field. 
Ball security was an issue in both seasons at Virginia Tech.
Lacks decisiveness and feel for lane development. 
Would like to see him process and burst more quickly.
Will bounce a run wide instead of trusting and working behind a lead block.
Needs to learn to avoid the hellish contact and collisions he frequently takes on.
Has trouble securing passes that are outside of his frame.

Patience and vision will run hot and cold between the tackles. Want to see improvements anticipating in creating point of entry. Relies on east-west cuts; more likely to bounce than cut back inside. Ball security must improve (nine fumbles over two seasons with Hokies). Plays with energy in pass pro but technique isn't on same level, leading to breakdowns. Battled left ankle issue over final month of senior season (Nov. 2024).",spendmuch muchtime timefocusing focusingsmall smallinconsistencies inconsistenciestuten tutencollege collegegame gamerun

Kaleb Johnson,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kaleb-johnson/32004a4f-4839-8805-a441-bdb3ea3187ea,"Johnson is built like a bruiser, but his style is more finesse, preferring to win with tempo and decisiveness. He keeps his runs on time and on track while allowing blockers to do their job. He’s not overly aggressive, but he has the size and strength to break tackles and grab extra yards at the finish. He runs with below-average creativity and cut quickness but has consistent linear play speed to pop chunk runs. He can catch, but his three-down value takes a hit because of his struggles in pass pro. Johnson’s traits and running style make him a projectable fit in a two-back system with the upside to take on a bigger chunk down the road.
A one-year starter at Iowa, Johnson was the focal point of ofensive coordinator Tim Lester's run-heavy, zone-blocking scheme (62.5percent of Iowa's snaps in 2024 used multiple tight ends, No. 2 in the FBS). He exploded onto the NFL radar with a prolific 2024 season and setsingle-season Iowa records for total touchdowns (23), rushing touchdowns (21) and total points scored (138). He also became just the third playerin school history to eclipse 1,500 rushing yards in a season. Despite consistently facing stacked boxes (Iowa ranked 130th out of 133 FBS teams inpassing ofense in 2024), Johnson shined on outside zone.He is at his best when he can quickly read and set up his blocks and anticipate backside/frontside lanes to find yardage that isn't there (No. 2 in theFBS with 21 carries of 20 yards or more in 2024). He tends to run upright, giving defenders a large target, but has the build and determination to bea bruiser as a forward-leaning, north-south runner. Overall, Johnson isn't a dynamic make-you-miss athlete, but he is a patient and powerfulone-cut runner with the instinctive vision to crease the defense using run angles and foot quickness. His play style is reminiscent of DeMarcoMurray with a three-down skill set to thrive in a zone-based NFL scheme.","
Good size with an athletic, proportional frame.
Handled heavier workload and produced at a high level.
Running style tends to be patient but decisive.
Operates with consistent tempo and a trust for the run track.
Keeps feet active while reading block development.
Brushes off second-level tacklers and piles up explosive carries.
Capable of bringing in off-frame throws.

Physically put-together with power throughout his frame. Runs square with strong base and forward momentum to make tacklers feel it at contact (draws inspiration from Derrick Henry). Consistently carries tacklers for extra yards (1,060 rushing yards after contact in 2024). Processes really well to read backside cuts, follow blocks and navigate holes. Shines on toss, outside zone or plays with horizontal flow. Stays light on his feet to slide, redirect and make timely cuts. Average long speed but initial acceleration allows him to get downhill through lanes. Zero fumbles in 2024. Reliable pass catcher with big, strong hands in screen game. Held up well when asked to pass protect — and should continue getting better. Stamina runner and looked stronger deep into games (8.3 yards per carry in the fourth quarter in 2024). Scored at least one touchdown in all 12 regular-season games in '24 and set Iowa record for points in a season. Iowa running backs coach and former NFL player Ladell Betts said Johnson ""sets the example"" for the offense in terms of how to work.","
Average bend leads to an upright running style.
Lacks sudden acceleration after feet are slowed.
Below-average contact aggression for his size.
Not enough lateral agility for sharp back-side cuts across the grain.
Unlikely to be trusted with third-down protection duties.

Inconsistent pad level through first-level holes. Not a home-run hitter and long speed taps out. Average elusiveness and will struggle to avoid direct hits. Can do a better job setting up second-level moves. Work in progress as a blocker (averaged just 2.4 pass-blocking snaps per game in 2024). Suffered high-ankle sprain during 2023 fall camp and tried to play through it before missing three games.

Jordan James,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-james/32004a41-4d27-1034-c903-85aadc450efd,"Physical runner with a compact frame and lower center of gravity. James punches way above his weight class when it comes to breaking tackles and doling out punishment, but his ability to suddenly cut and change direction should not be minimized. He plays fast but lacks patience to allow his blocks to develop. Early success on runs over the tackle can eventually lead to collision finishes, where he ducks his eyes instead of seeking to find a cut or move. James lacks finesse, but his ability to get tough yards could create draft value as a RB3 with a chance to develop into a larger role in time.
A one-year starter at Oregon, James became the featured back in ofensive coordinator Will Stein's RPO-based, multiple run scheme(inside zone, counter, duo, etc.). After sharing backfield duties with Bucky Irving in 2023, he became the starter in 2024 and helped lead the Ducks(and the Big Ten's top-ranked ofense) to an undefeated regular season, including the conference championship (in Oregon's first season in the BigTen).Built low to the ground, James is quick to scan, drop his pads and slam the gas through cracks at the line of scrimmage (36.5 percent of his 2024carries resulted in a first down or touchdown, No. 2 in the FBS). You can't measure his determination with a stopwatch or measuring tape. Heripped of a ton of doubles but wasn't much of a home-run threat — he ranked 10th in the FBS in carries of 10 or more yards (39) but 173rd incarries of 20 or more yards (3). Overall, James' well-rounded, no-nonsense run style will translate well to the NFL game, as will his feel formaximizing runs at the line of scrimmage and making the first man miss, which he does in multiple diferent ways (power, balance, quickness,vision). He has the talent to quickly ascend to the top of a team's running back depth chart — and stay there.","
Hits sudden lateral cuts to elude early penetration from the defense.
Instant stop-start and change-of-direction quickness.
Absorbs and runs through contact with powerful lower half.
Looks to demolish defensive backs who try to tackle him.
Able to take short throws and add yards after the catch.
Displays a willingness to hit and compete in pass protection.

Short and stocky with a cut-up physique. Creates strong forward momentum to keep his balance and grind his legs through contact. Decisive zone runner with above-average vision. Skillfully baits defenders and sets up blocks before cutting away from leverage. Works well in tight spaces with quick footwork and wiggle to gravitate toward openings. Runs with attitude and consistently picks up more yardage than he should. Has a nose for the sticks (one of just five FBS backs with 85 or more first downs in 2024). Reliable ball security and won't put ball on the ground (zero career fumbles). Has receiving traits to become an asset in screen game. Stout, leverage-based blocker with good awareness in pass pro. Played entire junior season of high school without PCL in right knee after tearing it riding jet skis in summer 2020; underwent surgery after leading Oakland to state championship in December 2020. Plenty of tread left on tires (428 career touches).","
Rushes the run and climbs on top of blockers.
Lacks finesse to manipulate and elude linebackers.
Acceleration and top-end speed look average on tape.
Below-average feel for spacing between the tackles.
Below-average hands with small catch radius in space.

Inconsistent make-you-miss ability at second level. Makes strong cuts to elude downhill pursuit but not as comfortable stringing together multiple moves. Foot gets a tad heavy on the pedal at times. Questionable open-field speed to be big-play threat (one of 233 carries in 2024 resulted in a play of more than 25 yards). Frequent visitor to end zone, but all 15 rushing touchdowns in 2024 came from inside red zone. Needs to cut down on focus drops as a pass catcher. Knocked out of Rose Bowl against Ohio State because of a concussion (Jan. 2025).",OREGON,137,RB,San Francisco 49ers,2025,"Physical runner with a compact frame and lower center of gravity.

Cam Skattebo,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cam-skattebo/3200534b-4157-8439-e202-fa5ff0631271,"Carnage creator with a compact frame and elite contact balance. Skattebo can break through second-level tacklers and careen off of bodies for extended yards after contact. He reads his blocks quickly and is more elusive in the early stages of the run than he’s probably given credit for. He lacks top-end speed and will have to contend with bigger, better tacklers on the next level. Skattebo’s effectiveness as a receiver out of the backfield should add to his draft value. His physicality and edge should bode well for him as a complementary back with three-down value who is capable of helping an offense wear down the defense.
 A two-year starter at Arizona State, Skattebo was the featured weapon in ofensive coordinator Marcus Arroyo's spread, multiple runscheme. After two years at Sacramento State (Skattebo didn't have any FBS ofers out of high school), he achieved legendary status in Tempe,Ariz., by leading the Sun Devils to the 2024 Big 12 championship and College Football Playof. He finished fifth in 2024 Heisman Trophy voting andset Arizona State's single-season school records for rushing yards (1,711), rushing touchdowns (21) and total touchdowns (24).Skattebo will struggle with some short-area cuts once he gets rolling downhill and can do a better job pressing the line, but his best traits are hisfinishing toughness and sturdy balance to absorb hits, which make him a chore to tackle. He needs to improve his consistency as a pass blocker,but his versatility as a receiver is an asset (first FBS player with 1,500 yards or more rushing and 500 yards or more receiving in the same seasonsince Christian McCafrey). Overall, Skattebo is a thickly built, compact runner who is more quick than explosive, but he competes withtremendous resolve and understands how to rely on his pad level and contact balance to get the most out of every carry. He is a draftableoption for a team looking to upgrade its backfield physicality.","
Built low to the ground with a compact, muscular frame.
Runs with excellent footwork in tight quarters.
Makes sudden, sharp alterations to the run lane when needed due to penetration.
Bursts into his top speed fairly quickly. 
Either breaks defender’s tackle or makes them feel his force.
Elite run extender, relying on outstanding leg drive and contact balance.
Quick vertical transition from catch to run underneath.
Adds yards after contact on swing passes and throws to the flat.

Short and stocky with brawny body composition. Runs with tremendous balance and abides by ""low man wins"" slogan. Drops square pads into contact to create a stalemate, then drives his legs to leverage forward (he would excel in rugby). Slams inside with determined strength to grind out yards. Runs with vision and downhill urgency to find the crease. Doesn't stay in one place too long, displaying agile footwork to weave or jump cut. Builds up speed as he goes to create big plays (20 plays of 20 yards or more in 2024 — 12 rushes, eight catches). Soft-handed receiver and catches with ease. Wired differently and has always been mentally and physically tough (According to his mother, at age 6, he would wear his brother's pads and run into telephone poles at football fields while the older kids were playing). Versatile skill set (19 career pass attempts for 191 yards, three touchdowns and one interception). Punted eight times in 2023 (three times for 50 yards or more) and played on kickoff coverage in 2024. Finished No. 2 in FBS in rushing yards in 2024, behind only Ashton Jeanty.","
Heavy involvement in punishing collisions could impact durability.
Lacks desired acceleration out of his cuts.
Must improve his ball security on the next level.
Missing straight-line speed to outrun NFL pursuit.
Limited catch radius requires an accurate passer.
Needs to square rusher instead of seeking shoulder shots.

Short strider and takes a moment to get going, which leads to excess contact at or behind line of scrimmage. Average burst and start-stop ability. Lack of immediate juice will be more apparent on stretch plays against NFL pursuit. Impatient pressing line of scrimmage and too eager barreling into contact. Courageous runner but takes a lot of pounding — doesn't always need to show how tough he is. Extra hits on body will lead to ball-security concerns (10 combined fumbles over past three seasons). Has body type and functional strength needed for pass pro but eye level and mechanics are inconsistent. Missed one game as senior because of shoulder injury (Nov. 2024).",ARIZONA STATE,99,RB,New York Giants,2025,"Carnage creator with a compact frame and elite contact balance.

He lacks the speed and power of his brother, the Jacksonville Jaguars’ Travis Etienne, but Trevor wins with vision, elusiveness and efficiency. He is capable inside and does a nice job of staying tight to the track but could struggle to get tough yards. He runs with average burst wide but sets up tacklers and gets in and out of cuts without losing speed. Etienne catches with sticky hands, evades tacklers in space and has a very good understanding of protections. He has middle-round value but could become a third-down option early in his career.","
Eludes early traffic to give the run a chance.
Runs with good bend and balance through the line.
Makes smooth transitions to cut and accelerate.
Sets up open-field tacklers to miss on sweeps and tosses.
Quick, soft hands catch everything in their vicinity.
Stacks yards after catch with wiggle and field vision.
Sorts through blitzes and twists like a champ in pass pro.

Compactly built and runs bigger than listed, with a muscular lower half. Pairs his feet with his eyes at the line to set up moves. Agile footwork for sharp cuts and last-minute redirects. Runs with tempo and balance through the hole. Gathers and establishes his weight quickly post-cut. Consistently finishes runs with toughness. Large, accepting hands as a receiving target — rarely let a pass hit the ground. Just 371 carries in college, so he has plenty of tread left. Became an offensive leader at Georgia (Kirby Smart: ""He hasn't had even a full year with these guys, but he's not afraid to speak up."").","
On the smaller side for volume carries in the league.
Below-average getaway burst in small spaces.
Lacks base strength to tear free from arm tacklers.
Doesn’t offer explosive playmaking speed.
Arrested in March 2024 on four charges, including DUI; served one-game suspension to open the season after charges were dropped in July.

Inconsistent open-field moves once he clears the line of scrimmage. Can get bounce-happy at times. Fumbled twice in 2024 (Notre Dame and Alabama tapes). Showed promise in pass protection, but he wasn't asked to do it a ton on his 2024 tape. Wasn't asked to be a workhorse (20 carries or more just once in his 34 career games). Suspended for 2024 season opener after he was arrested and charged with reckless driving and underage possession of alcohol (March 2024); charges were later dismissed after Etienne pleaded no contest. Rib injury sidelined him for three games (Oct. 2024) and bothered him much of his final college season; missed his freshman year of high school after suffering a broken fibula (Aug. 2018).

A former no-star recruit, he worked his way up thedepth chart once he arrived in Manhattan and topped 1,200 rushing yards in back-to-back seasons (6.0 yards per carry over his career).Giddens displays good vision, tempo and cutting skills at the line of scrimmage, and he is at his best when he has room to anticipate angles andsidestep or spin out of tackles. However, there is a massive gap between the talent level of tacklers in the Big 12 and what he will see in theNFL — thus far, he's been able to get away with some of his tentative tendencies. Overall, Giddens is a narrow, upright runner and doesn't have agrind-it-out mentality, but his gliding quickness and innate balance help him create. He projects best in an NFL scheme with a play caller whocan get him into space as part of a committee.","
Workhorse with good size and strong production.
Runs with patience, allowing bigs to get to their blocks.
Vision to see and cut into developing run lanes.
More elusive than he should be in tight quarters.
Only one fumble over his last two seasons (428 carries), per PFF.

Fluid in lower half to pick, slide and wiggle through traffic. Lateral quickness allows him to shake one-on-one defenders (safeties don't want to see him in open field). Scans patiently at line with cutback ability. Anticipates holes before they expand and gets skinny through creases. Run balance helps keep himself afloat post-contact. Showed tracking skills on deep wheel route on 2024 Tulane tape. Quiet and reserved but described by his coaches as a ""humble worker."" Consistent production — averaged 102.8 rushing yards per game over 25 starts.","
Runs with long strides, making it tougher to find quick cuts.
Lacks lateral quicks and long speed to create chunk runs.
Inconsistent knee bend and power as a run finisher.
Struggles to bring in off-frame throws.
Will get the quarterback hit too often in protection.

Linear build and needs to continue adding mass to his frame. Doesn't always play up to stopwatch speed. Runs with tall pads and average power (won't push pile). Not a punisher between the tackles — would like to see better leg churn. Adjusts well to the football as a pass catcher, but drops started to add up on tape (five on 32 targets in 2024). Core strength and technique are equal problems in pass protection (see 2024 Kansas tape).

Richardson is durable enough to handle a season full of carries, and with the new CBA rules putting a ceiling on rookie salaries, it will be tough for teams to pass on such a talented, polished back that will be a franchise back for years to come.","Richardson is as compact and coiled an athlete that the running back position has seen since Adrian Peterson. Richardson is explosive, powerful and balanced, the three most shining traits that are evident when he ran the ball for Alabama. He is a heady and instinctual player who is patient enough to wait for blocks to develop within the scheme and quick enough to change course and cut backfield to daylight. Richardson has a strong core that he uses to break arm tackles and get physical leverage under would-be blockers or blitzers in pass protection. He is a true three-down back who can be effective on screens and out of the backfield catching the ball. Richardson is an ideal height, big enough to remain a force in the power run game, yet small enough to remain elusive and hide behind blocks.","Richardson ran behind a very good, experienced offensive line at Alabama. Nick Saban has brought in so much talent, parlayed with a top-notch, NFL savvy coaching staff, that nearly every position has a top draftable athlete honing it. Mark Ingram won the Heisman a year ago as the best player on the best team, and to some Richardson could be an example of a smart, serviceable player running in a talented offense. Richardson will likely prove that he has the talent to make plays on his own, but much of his production were yards on plays in a good scheme with a seam and an opportunity to get to linebacker and safety level without much trouble.

David Wilson,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/david-wilson/32005749-4c67-2509-b1da-046246de6e8d,"Wilson is an electrifying runner who opted to come out early after an incredible junior year where he was named ACC Player of the Year. He truly runs with his own style, and it's obvious that he has love for the game. He was one of very few limited prospects who played for Team USA prior to enrolling in college, dominating the tournament and displaying elite athletic ability. He is a high risk-high reward player who loves to reverse field on the entire defense. He is a decorated track star who shows obvious explosion every time he touches the ball.","Wilson is extremely explosive and quick-twitched off the snap. He can accelerate to top speed quickly and neutralizes the negative effects of his small frame by lowering his pad level into hits. He is so explosive and generates such movement with his leg drive that he is capable of running over linebackers but prefers to use his agility to make guys miss in space. Wilson is just as electric working as a receiver out of the backfield or in the slot, and its likely he could be used in a variety of alignments early on in his NFL career.","Wilson relied heavily on his athletic ability in college and runs with a very unconventional style that could get him in trouble at the next level against top athletes. He will allow his pad level to get high when changing directions downfield, and he will get caught off guard with that style at the next level. He isn't content enough with a 2-to-3-yard gain and will revert cross-field to try and make a play out of nothing, another habit that simply won't end well in most cases in the NFL. He needs to be more patient to let the plays and blocks come to him and play within a scheme, rather than try to make everything happen on his own each time he gets the ball.",VIRGINIA TECH,32,RB,New York Giants,2011,"Wilson is an electrifying runner who opted to come out early after an incredible junior year where he was named ACC Player of the Year.

He is a better runner between the tackles than his frame would suggest, as he uses a quick shuffle to avoid trash or get up and into an open lane.

He is a bit undersized but has the speed and quickness to be an immediately impactful back in the NFL. He likely won't demand the bulk of the carries for an NFL team but is a good ""change of pace"" guy and does a lot of things well enough to project to make an impact.","Hillman relies heavily on his quickness off the snap and immediate vision to find a seam to be an effective runner. He has decent speed for his size, but his quickness is how he makes his plays. He has a good, natural feel for how to find daylight and can be patient to wait for a pulling interior lineman to get to the second level. He is a RB who plays much more with his instincts and savvy with the ball in his hands than one who relies on athletic ability. He has a good burst in a short area to make guys miss, and has the quickness to be an effective short-yardage back in the NFL.","Hillman is a very smooth mover who is not very explosive with the ball in his hands. He likes to feel his way through the line of scrimmage and usually gets to the second level with ease, but he struggles to run with power or elusiveness to make defenders miss and really break for a big gain. He averaged 5.5 yards per carry in his senior year, but those numbers were a bit skewed thanks to some outlier-type big runs.

Hillman relies heavily on his quickness off the snap and immediate vision to find a seam to be an effective runner. He has decent speed for his size, but his quickness is how he makes his plays. He has a good, natural feel for how to find daylight and can be patient to wait for a pulling interior lineman to get to the second level. He is a RB who plays much more with his instincts and savvy with the ball in his hands than one who relies on athletic ability. He has a good burst in a short area to make guys miss, and has the quickness to be an effective short-yardage back in the NFL. Hillman is a very smooth mover who is not very explosive with the ball in his hands. He likes to feel his way through the line of scrimmage and usually gets to the second level with ease, but he struggles to run with power or elusiveness to make defenders miss and really break for a big gain. He averaged 5.5 yards per carry in his senior year, but those numbers were a bit skewed thanks to some outlier-type big runs.

Richardson has a strong core that he uses to break arm tackles and get physical leverage under would-be blockers or blitzers in pass protection. He is a true three-down back who can be effective on screens and out of the backfield catching the ball.

David Wilson,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/david-wilson/32005749-4c67-2509-b1da-046246de6e8d,"Wilson is an electrifying runner who opted to come out early after an incredible junior year where he was named ACC Player of the Year. He truly runs with his own style, and it's obvious that he has love for the game. He was one of very few limited prospects who played for Team USA prior to enrolling in college, dominating the tournament and displaying elite athletic ability. He is a high risk-high reward player who loves to reverse field on the entire defense. He is a decorated track star who shows obvious explosion every time he touches the ball.","Wilson is extremely explosive and quick-twitched off the snap. He can accelerate to top speed quickly and neutralizes the negative effects of his small frame by lowering his pad level into hits. He is so explosive and generates such movement with his leg drive that he is capable of running over linebackers but prefers to use his agility to make guys miss in space. Wilson is just as electric working as a receiver out of the backfield or in the slot, and its likely he could be used in a variety of alignments early on in his NFL career.","Wilson relied heavily on his athletic ability in college and runs with a very unconventional style that could get him in trouble at the next level against top athletes. He will allow his pad level to get high when changing directions downfield, and he will get caught off guard with that style at the next level. He isn't content enough with a 2-to-3-yard gain and will revert cross-field to try and make a play out of nothing, another habit that simply won't end well in most cases in the NFL. He needs to be more patient to let the plays and blocks come to him and play within a scheme, rather than try to make everything happen on his own each time he gets the ball.",VIRGINIA TECH,32,RB,New York Giants,2012,"Wilson is an electrifying runner who opted to come out early after an incredible junior year where he was named ACC Player of the Year.

Isaiah Pead,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/isaiah-pead/32005045-4114-1066-adc8-35b162f3ad72,"Pead is an explosive, electrifying running back from Cincinnati who has produced in all areas. He can catch the ball out of the backfield, make a guy miss and turn upfield for a score, or do all that from running inside the tackles. He uses his vision and athletic ability to find a hole and once there has the long speed to take it the distance. There are few question marks around the skill set of Pead's game; some may worry about his play transferring to the next level, as he has shown the tendency to disappear at times. But with Pead's natural athletic ability and production at the position, he should be one of the first three backs taken in the draft, with second-round value.","Pead has an initial step out of his stance that is comparable to some of the best backs currently in the league. He hits the hole explosively and gets up to top speed quickly, which allows him to get upfield and find a seam without getting touched. He has good vision once he gets through the hole, and displays the foot quickness and lateral agility to make the first defender miss. But he is careful to stick his foot in the ground and get upfield to pick up yards. He can dance around defenders but prefers to cut once and go. He can get the edge on a defense and has the breakaway speed thereafter. His burst, footwork and vision allow him to be a viable pass-catching option out of the backfield. Although he didn't do it much at Cincinnati, he is likely to catch a lot of passes at the next level. ","Pead isn't a willing blocker and barely displays the strength to stall rushers when he does step in.

An invitee to the Heisman Trophy presentation the past two years, James has been the most electric and productive player on a very impressive Oregon offense. He was an ideal fit for the unique zone blocking scheme run by Chip Kelly in Eugene and has shown many traits that are transferable to potential success in the NFL. Teams could get hung up on his size and question if he was the beneficiary of simply being the centerpiece of a highly productive spread-option offense, but hw has shown quality traits on a consistent basis.","James is a quick and decisive back who looks like his motive is to be productive each time the ball touches his hands. He can get to full speed quickly off the snap and doesn't hesitate when hitting the line of scrimmage. He is capable of making splash plays out of nothing and possesses the uncanny ability to turn broken plays into positive ones. He is a better runner between the tackles than his frame would suggest, as he uses a quick shuffle to avoid trash or get up and into an open lane. Once through the line, he can make things happen on his own downfield, and routinely had runs of 20-plus yards at Oregon. He is a consummate threat to score, and has the foot quickness and breakout speed to get the edge and turn up field at the next level. ","James had fumbling issues throughout his career that weren't helped by a dislocated elbow midway through his junior season.

He is a bit undersized but has the speed and quickness to be an immediately impactful back in the NFL. He likely won't demand the bulk of the carries for an NFL team but is a good ""change of pace"" guy and does a lot of things well enough to project to make an impact.","Hillman relies heavily on his quickness off the snap and immediate vision to find a seam to be an effective runner. He has decent speed for his size, but his quickness is how he makes his plays. He has a good, natural feel for how to find daylight and can be patient to wait for a pulling interior lineman to get to the second level. He is a RB who plays much more with his instincts and savvy with the ball in his hands than one who relies on athletic ability. He has a good burst in a short area to make guys miss, and has the quickness to be an effective short-yardage back in the NFL.","Hillman is a very smooth mover who is not very explosive with the ball in his hands. He likes to feel his way through the line of scrimmage and usually gets to the second level with ease, but he struggles to run with power or elusiveness to make defenders miss and really break for a big gain.

He is a good runner in the open field and has some deceptive juke moves that he will put on bigger players. Ballard carries the ball high and tight and is very conscious of oncoming traffic to be a dependable inside runner. His value early on is that he is a big body who is willing to block oncoming linebackers in pass protection, and is also a good check-down option in the pass game who understands how to work up field and pick up first downs after catching the ball. Ballard is also a willing special teamer who likes to fly around and seeks contact. Ballard is not a very quick-twitched athlete. He is big, but doesn't run with a ton of power and bigger linebackers often bring him down on first contact. He is instinctual inside and when he has the ball in his hands in the flats, but he does not have the speed to get to the edge on his own. He is natural between the tackles, and a deer in headlights in the open field.",ballardbig bigback backproductive productivethroughout throughoutcareer careermississippi mississippistate ballard big

Andre Ellington,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andre-ellington/3200454c-4c16-4917-7ff5-a9acfbf007ba,"Ellington turned in a second-team All-ACC season in 2011 and first-team in 2012, taking the lead with back-to-back thousand yard rushing seasons. His elite straight-line speed (if only average size) allows him to press the line with authority and accelerate to freedom, yet he still shows patience when following his blockers –- a dangerous combination for opposing defenses. He has been productive and has shown toughness as an inside runner, but his size and limitations in pass protection will likely leave him as a rotational runner in the NFL. Space players with speed are at a major premium in the NFL, though, and he figures to go in the second round of the draft.
","Possesses above-average straight-line speed. Attacks the line of scrimmage in one-back formations. Good vision and foot quickness for the cutback, has a burst through the hole and can accelerate away from oncoming defenders. Tough for college safeties to get an angle on. Excellent balance in the open field to cut, put his hand on the ground to stay upright, or even leap sprawling defenders. Runs with some lean for his size, and he lowers his pads pre-contact to get an extra yard. Takes big hits and bounces back up. Tight-ropes the sideline when necessary to maximize runs. Shows the ability to create behind the line of scrimmage when the play side breaks down, and the creativity and knowledge of pursuit angles to set up second level defenders. Shows patience running behind pulling guards and fullbacks, can cut in either direction off the block. Stiff-arm in the open field can be effective in keeping away defensive backs. Very dangerous in space. Good hands to be a threat as a receiver in the flat, over the middle, on screens, and down the sideline on wheel routes. Dangerous kick returner who can slide through creases and explode into the open with quick cuts and pure acceleration.","Undersized, and lacks great power as an inside back, though he has some lower-body strength and the effort is there when trying to run clock. Does not possess elite agility to elude defenders in space, and can be brought down by glancing tackle attempts. Cuts are not consistently decisive or strong. Pass protection skills are lacking, lays down at the feet of defenders instead of holding his ground. Generally holds the ball high and tight, but upper-body strength is not exceptional so the ball will come out on occasion.

There’s no questioning his toughness, carries the mail 30 times a game and gives great effort trying to use his good lean to plow through arm tackles for extra yardage. Not used as a receiver very often, but his solid hands, quickness and agility will make him a valued weapon in the passing game. Those hands make him a solid safety valve punt returner, as well, even if he hasn’t yet shown explosiveness in that duty. Not the most powerful of backs, NFL defenders will stone him at the point of attack more regularly than their college counterparts because of his average lower-body strength. Leggy runner who can look out of control at times, though he usually manages to keep his balance. His pass protection form is inconsistent; sometimes he will hold his ground and throw a shoulder into a blitzer, but veteran rushers will easily elude his attempts to lie at their feet.

Tempo and decisiveness are his calling cards, making him a highly talented inside/outside zone runner. He's a cerebral runner who understands block timing and uses quick-cut agility and rare spatial awareness to read and react to defenses beyond the second level. Swift isn't overly explosive as a home-run hitter and doesn't run with the violence of last year's top running back, Josh Jacobs. He can step right in and provide early stability and production as an efficient, every-down back with Offensive Rookie of the Year potential.","Compact build with strong lower body and three-down talent. Understands blocking schemes and trusts his big guys up front. Reads overflowing linebackers on zone carries making early run-lane adjustments. Rare feel and vision in tight quarters as interior runner. Listens to fluidity of the crease and takes what it gives him. Effective jump-cut allows him to press runs deep into the hole. Tremendous feel for spatial relationship. Maintains balance through twists, turns and contact. Gets right on top of tacklers before cutting. Quick to find acceleration after slowing his feet.

",GEORGIA,35,RB,Detroit Lions,2021,"Swift possesses the play traits and running style of a skillful NFL veteran and is the latest in an avalanche of talented Georgia backs. Tempo and decisiveness are his calling cards, making him a highly talented inside/outside zone runner. He's a cerebral runner who understands block timing and uses quick-cut agility and rare spatial awareness to read and react to defenses beyond the second level. Swift isn't overly explosive as a home-run hitter and doesn't run with the violence of last year's top running back, Josh Jacobs. He can step right in and provide early stability and production as an efficient, every-down back with Offensive Rookie of the Year potential. Compact build with strong lower body and three-down talent. Understands blocking schemes and trusts his big guys up front.

Dillon is capable of handling heavy workloads and wearing down defenses, but there is a concern from evaluators that it's taken a physical toll on him. He's a disciplined runner who trusts his blocking scheme and follows his rush track. He's a good one-cut runner with below-average wiggle but natural power to create yards after contact. Dillon will find more space as he faces fewer loaded boxes as a pro, but dropping weight and adding quickness could be the difference between a future as a committee back or starter.","Carries weight easily on big, well-proportioned frame. Above-average athletic traits for such a big runner. Went for 150-plus rushing yards in almost 42 percent of his career starts. Finds paydirt, with 39 career rushing touchdowns. Can move piles or leap over them. Absorbs contact like a big linebacker. Trusts the process and follows design of the rush track. Reads block development and acts decisively. Has grind-it-out mentality, but pitch plays and outside zone suits him. Stiff-arm cleans up the angles on the perimeter. Able to sort the rush and find his protection most of the time. Size to square and slow charging linebackers. ",May need to play lighter for increased quickness. Ran odometer high through rough terrain in BC offense. Scouts concerned about long-term durability. Not much creativity to elude sudden traffic in his face. One-cuts when deeper press of the line is needed. Burst to second level is just OK. Needs to square and accelerate into contact more consistently. Not a natural pass-catcher. Feet get stagnant taking on moving targets against blitz. ,BOSTON COLLEGE,62,RB,Green Bay Packers,2021,"Built like a minibus but possessing enough vision and finesse to avoid being pigeon-holed as just a pure power back.

Dillon will find more space as he faces fewer loaded boxes as a pro, but dropping weight and adding quickness could be the difference between a future as a committee back or starter. Carries weight easily on big, well-proportioned frame. Above-average athletic traits for such a big runner. Went for 150-plus rushing yards in almost 42 percent of his career starts. Finds paydirt, with 39 career rushing touchdowns. Can move piles or leap over them. Absorbs contact like a big linebacker. Trusts the process and follows design of the rush track. Reads block development and acts decisively. Has grind-it-out mentality, but pitch plays and outside zone suits him. Stiff-arm cleans up the angles on the perimeter. Able to sort the rush and find his protection most of the time. Size to square and slow charging linebackers.  May need to play lighter for increased quickness. Ran odometer high through rough terrain in BC offense. Scouts concerned about long-term durability. Not much creativity to elude sudden traffic in his face. One-cuts when deeper press of the line is needed. Burst to second level is just OK. Needs to square and accelerate into contact more consistently. Not a natural pass-catcher. Feet get stagnant taking on moving targets against blitz.

Jason Huntley,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jason-huntley/32004855-4e82-0991-c24d-2b6b3dad0477,"Lightweight scat-back who offers good versatility as a pass-catcher, change-of-pace runner and quality kick returner. While he has some wiggle and elusiveness, he takes an alarming amount of punishing blows and gets tossed around like a sack of laundry as an inside runner. He will need to pair with a team that utilizes his vision and tempo primarily on stretch plays. His play speed is just average, which hurts him when he becomes too predictable with his choice or rush paths. Huntley runs good routes and could be considered for usage in gadget packages that also take advantage of his ability to work from the slot.","Can splash around as a ball-carrier, pass catcher and kick returner. Averaged 7.1 yards per rush in 2019. Quick to process blocking development on stretch plays. Vision and change of direction for fluid run-lane choices. Able to alter run tempo for better elusiveness. His open-field spin move can shake and leave tacklers. Has five career kick returns for touchdowns. Legitimate pass-catching threat from the backfield or the slot. Gets out of breaks with some burst as a route runner. ",Angular build with narrow base not suited for inside running. Lacks leg drive to break tackles. Has a tendency to bounce too many runs wide. Better burst quickness than outright speed. Gets caught on dashes to the perimeter. Takes jarring punishment from tacklers. Put the ball on the ground twice right at the goal line. Carries the ball too loosely when approaching interior traffic.,NEW MEXICO STATE,155,RB,Detroit Lions,2021,"Lightweight scat-back who offers good versatility as a pass-catcher, change-of-pace runner and quality kick returner. While he has some wiggle and elusiveness, he takes an alarming amount of punishing blows and gets tossed around like a sack of laundry as an inside runner. He will need to pair with a team that utilizes his vision and tempo primarily on stretch plays. His play speed is just average, which hurts him when he becomes too predictable with his choice or rush paths. Huntley runs good routes and could be considered for usage in gadget packages that also take advantage of his ability to work from the slot. Can splash around as a ball-carrier, pass catcher and kick returner. Averaged 7.1 yards per rush in 2019. Quick to process blocking development on stretch plays. Vision and change of direction for fluid run-lane choices. Able to alter run tempo for better elusiveness. His open-field spin move can shake and leave tacklers. Has five career kick returns for touchdowns. Legitimate pass-catching threat from the backfield or the slot. Gets out of breaks with some burst as a route runner.  Angular build with narrow base not suited for inside running. Lacks leg drive to break tackles. Has a tendency to bounce too many runs wide. Better burst quickness than outright speed.

Travis Etienne,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/travis-etienne/32004554-4942-6541-8c54-a69299f0a040,"Rampaging, loose-hipped runner who wins with force and speed. Etienne's scheme will create favorable boxes for him to run into at times, but his contact balance and overall will to avoid being tackled has earned plenty of tough yardage. He has average size and runs with long strides and a frenetic pace that hampers his quick-cut control and fluidity at times. However, he has home-run speed in the open field and runs with fury and pop to finish near the goal line. He's a greatly improved pass-catching option but needs to step up consistently in pass protection. His tools for creating yardage stand out during games and that same presence should be on display as a dangerous pro back.
","
Very capable of excelling on all three downs.
Put it in the paint throughout career with 78 total touchdowns in four years.
Rabid determination to beat tacklers with ""fast"" or ""force.""
Had 16 career touchdowns of 44-plus yards.
Patient creeper, allowing power blocks to develop.
Excellent read-and-cut timing behind wash-down blocks.
Gets it downhill when it's time to go.
Leg drive and balance to power and bounce through contact.
YAC daddy whose default running style is set to rampage.
Several scores came after hard contact.
Hips can swivel and cut in any direction.
Top-end speed to make poor angles pay the iron price.
Elevated his value as receiver out of backfield in 2020.
Loves to clean up A-gap blitzers with booming angle block.

Long strider in short spaces.
Wide base limits lateral balance at times.
Running style is aggressive but somewhat segmented.
Lacks finesse along the interior at times.
Drops easy throws on swing passes.
Needs to square rushers and keep them centered.

Najee Harris,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/najee-harris/32004841-5249-3163-f8f5-73c55f8a5c0d,"Plus-sized runner who elevated his game and draft stock with a well-rounded performance in 2020. Harris showed improved short-area creativity and elusiveness to go with his trademark physicality. Creates additional yardage with both wiggle and power, but he lacks desired top gear to change games in a flash. He handled a heavier lift in 2020, with almost 300 total touches in 13 games. Harrisâ value as a third-down option out of the backfield and as a personal protector should not be underestimated after his performance in his senior year. His running style could shorten his career, but heâs a tough, three-down runner who can immediately upgrade a running game.

Javonte Williams,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/javonte-williams/32005749-4c35-1486-bb3e-8b9e35992111,"Big, broad bully back who runs with an exciting blend of animosity and feel as a future every-down starter in the league. With just 366 carries under his collegiate belt, Williams hasn't seen much tread come off the tires, but teams might speculate that his running style could lead to some in-season wear and tear. He's a terror behind his pads, creating yardage by battering and discarding tackle attempts. He sees the front fairly well and has above-average hips and the creativity to add to his rush total with more than just power. He lacks run-away speed for the long touchdowns but runs with above-average vision and contact balance to succeed at a high rate near the goal line. He tends to trust the blocking scheme and keep his runs on track but can recalibrate when needed. Williams is best-suited to gap, power and inside zone rather than flowing wide, where he lacks one-cut quickness. He will drop passes from time to time but has the route-running and protection toughness to take over as a three-down RB1 fairly early in his career.
","
Build is broad, powerful and rugged.
Plenty of tread left on the tires with just 366 career carries.
Quality feel for development and flow of the run lane.
Good creativity for a power back.
Runs a tight track off the blocker's hip on cuts.
Wide base with feet under him for A+ contact balance.
Very hard to stop in his tracks by one tackler.
Explodes through contact, sending defenders crashing to the ground.
Core strength pulls free of ankle tackles.
Stiff jabs discard angle tackles to perimeter.
Finds nooks and crannies to put it in the paint near goal line.
Stayed on his feet through heavy contact for several touchdowns.
Improved his recognition to find blitz pickup duties in 2020.
Runs wheel routes, circle routes and option routes out of backfield.


Physical downhill runner ; Strong to run through tackles ; Contact balance ; Gets yards after contact ; Strong lower body ; Short-yardage, goal-line asset ; Keeps feet going after contact ; Can move the pile ; Speed to hit the hole ; Acceleration ; Second gear to hit the second level ; Instinctive runner ; Good vision ; Patience ; Can create for himself ; Anticipation ; Good body lean to run low ; Bends at the knee ; Runs behind his pads ; Receiving ability ; Quality route-runner ; Quality hands ; Decisive runner ; Three-down starter ability","
Needs runway to gather and cut on stretch plays.
Average acceleration through line of scrimmage.
Just two career games with a run over 40 yards.
Running style could cause in-season wear and tear.
Might need to work on ball security.
Below-average hands with too many drops.
Dropped would-be fourth-down conversion to seal loss against FSU.
Can improve hand usage to better collect blitzers.


Good, but not great, speed ; Will need work as a blitz protector ;Summary:  The pandemic made the 2020 season very strange, including a variety of draft ramifications from the decreased amount of games and to fewer prospects taking the field.

He plays with good burst and could be a very good fit for an outside-zone scheme where he can one-cut downhill and get into space.

Trey Sermon,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/trey-sermon/32005345-5244-0716-5cc1-b1699fcf5156,"Great-looking running back at a quick glance, but one who suffers from inconsistency in creativity and decisiveness. The regular-season tape at Ohio State was fairly disappointing relative to the talent he showed at Oklahoma, but his monster postseason should quell some concerns. At both schools, the interior vision and decision-making was suspect and would run him into some traffic. He does have potential as an outside-zone back, where he has more time and space to utilize his skills. He has size and open-field speed and will step up and handle his business in pass protection, as well as catch it out of the backfield. So, while Sermon's skill level as a runner is somewhat average, his potential as a three-down backup with upside should create middle-round interest.
","
Possesses NFL frame with good size and build.
Tape at Oklahoma is more indicative of his game-in, game-out potential.
Adequate bend and cut when he's on the move.
Good acceleration after change of direction.
Strides with power and drive once he opens it up.
Finishes runs with forceful demeanor.
Has ability to put moves together as outside zone runner.
Capable pass catcher with ability to hit chunk plays out of backfield.
Run after catch was impressive and effective in 2018 and 2020.
Squares up and meets his pass-blocking duties.
Stepped up with huge efforts when it was most needed for Buckeyes.


Physical runner ; Quality quickness ; Strong build ; Has stretches of running angry and aggressive ; Power to run through tackles ; Finishes runs extremely well ; Falls forward for extra yards ; Strength to churn forward through tacklers ; Contact balance ; Effective stiff arm ; Picks up yards after contact ; Second gear to hit the second level ; Speed to hit the hole ; Keeps feet going after contact ; Three-down starter potential","
Most consistent in-season tape was back in 2018.
Tends to run too upright.
Slow to process moving pieces in tight quarters.
Indecisive and didn't crank up as much aggression into contact.
Lacks vision and burst to make a living between the tackles.
Uncreative runner for much of his time in an Ohio State jersey.


Can’t create for himself ; Not shifty ; Lacks anticipation ; Below-average vision ; Below average at setting up blocks ; Will need work as a blitz protector ;Summary:  Even though Sermon never produced a 1,000-yard season in college, he is clearly a gifted running back who has the ability to do a lot more. Sermon played at Oklahoma for three seasons before transferring to Ohio State, and at both programs, Sermon was part of a running back rotation with other future NFL competitors. If Sermon had gone to a school with less backfield talent and played as the feature back, he could have produced some huge stat lines across his college career.",OHIO STATE,89,RB,San Francisco 49ers,2021,"Great-looking running back at a quick glance, but one who suffers from inconsistency in creativity and decisiveness.

Stevenson's burly, thick frame and punishing demeanor clearly takes a toll on defenses as the game rolls on.

Struggles to play under control and harness energy.
Herky-jerky as downhill runner.
Lacks tempo and feels like he's in a constant footrace.
Impatient allowing blocks to develop.
Interior vision can be very hit or miss.

Khalil Herbert,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/khalil-herbert/32004845-5203-4169-7d1a-e33edb9fea8e,"A tempo-based runner with a well-built, compact frame, Herbert runs with a good blend of vision and strength. The Kansas graduate transfer made his single season at Virginia Tech count with a strong showing, ranking among the FBS' top five in rushing yards and yards per carry. He's a little tight-hipped, which prevents him from being a true, one-cut runner, but his vision and speed to the corner make it work for him. He's not a wiggle runner and needs to have some blocking up front to keep his feet moving, but his quick processing of the run lanes and smooth change of direction allow him to create yards for himself within the scheme. His lack of pass pro talent could hurt his draft value. He's worthy of a Day 3 selection and has NFL backup talent.

",VIRGINIA TECH,193,RB,Chicago Bears,2021,"A tempo-based runner with a well-built, compact frame, Herbert runs with a good blend of vision and strength. The Kansas graduate transfer made his single season at Virginia Tech count with a strong showing, ranking among the FBS' top five in rushing yards and yards per carry. He's a little tight-hipped, which prevents him from being a true, one-cut runner, but his vision and speed to the corner make it work for him. He's not a wiggle runner and needs to have some blocking up front to keep his feet moving, but his quick processing of the run lanes and smooth change of direction allow him to create yards for himself within the scheme. His lack of pass pro talent could hurt his draft value. He's worthy of a Day 3 selection and has NFL backup talent.
 
Received team's Williams-Moss Award for highest quality of leadership and character.
Well-built with muscular, strong legs.
Runs with easy tempo and good decisiveness.
Able to gas it through line of scrimmage when hole develops.
Instant, clear processing of run lanes while on the move.
Maintains speed with smooth change of direction.
Throws pursuit off with quick lane fakes and bounce outs.
Speed to turn the corner on outside zone.
Runs behind his pads and falls forward as finisher.

Chris Evans,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chris-evans/32004556-4110-5967-b1b8-845c260e1531,"Running back with good size and adequate athletic traits but lacking dynamic or explosive qualities to help him stand out. Evans served a suspension in 2019 and had very few totes in 2020. From 2016 to 2018, he ran to his size and was productive relative to what was asked of him. His pad level and contact balance will create yards after contact and he'll get what is blocked. However, his greatest selling point will be his size and ability to play on third down. Those two things could help rehabilitate his draft stock, but there will be an abundance of competition for the job he will be looking for. It could just be a matter of finding the right place at the right time.

Excellent knee bend and pad level through the hole.
Vision to recognize bounce-wide opportunities.
Has lateral-cut quickness and burst to get to the edge.
Weaponizes stiff-arm to extend his run.
Lowers and squares pads to fall forward through contact.
Squares blitzers and sticks a heavy lead shoulder into chip blocks.
Pass-catching comes easily for him.
Hands are soft and natural, plucking throws on the move.

Below-average fumble rate throughout career.
Looks for clear points of entry into the line.
Average burst up to second level.
Lacks tempo and flow of a natural outside zone back.
Running style is not dynamic or explosive.
Will need to upgrade take-on technique as a third-down blocker.

",MICHIGAN,178,RB,Cincinnati Bengals,2021,"Running back with good size and adequate athletic traits but lacking dynamic or explosive qualities to help him stand out. Evans served a suspension in 2019 and had very few totes in 2020. From 2016 to 2018, he ran to his size and was productive relative to what was asked of him. His pad level and contact balance will create yards after contact and he'll get what is blocked. However, his greatest selling point will be his size and ability to play on third down. Those two things could help rehabilitate his draft stock, but there will be an abundance of competition for the job he will be looking for. It could just be a matter of finding the right place at the right time.

He lacks foot quickness and the desired field vision to find pathways and yardage on his own, so power will need to become his calling card. He looks more comfortable lining up behind the quarterback and attacking the flanks, where he has longer to process the defense and can get his momentum building. He does just enough out of the backfield and has decent pass pro potential. He might go undrafted but has enough going for him to get a look.
 
Broad lower body with thick legs.
Productivity hurt by inconsistent blocking at times.
Gets his speed up when hitting the outside carry.
Good forward lean and lowered pads as finisher.
Size and strength to pinball off tacklers when he's cranked up.
Improved in 2020 at keeping his feet moving through contact.
Puts pepper into his chip blocks and blitz pickups.

 
Not very quick out of his stance.
Blurry field vision in reading the defensive front.
Lethargic feet slow jump-cuts and lateral movements.
Doesn't show much savvy getting through lanes cleanly.
Won't wiggle enough to elude tacklers.
Fumbling issues need to be corrected.
Pass-catching can be a labor for him.
