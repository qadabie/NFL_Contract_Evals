Melvin Gordon,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/melvin-gordon/3200474f-5227-5321-5a9f-5d54a292e030,"Angular, talented open-field runner who combines outstanding burst with a long stride to gain separation and hit the home run. He won't be able to outrun NFL defenders like he did in college and must develop more feel between the tackles. Gordon shines when his track runs over tackle or around the end and can put a defense to sleep around the corner. Not trustworthy enough to be a three-down back, but his pass-catching improved enough to utilize him out of backfield as a receiver.","Tall, leggy running back with shredded physique. Transitions run from inside to outside without losing any speed. Can cover five yards in two strides when fully unlocked in open field. Impressive 20-yard burst, creating space to hit the big runs. Averaged 7.6 yards per carry over last two seasons. Had 40 runs for 15-plus yards in 2014. Shifty in open field without having to hesitate. Uses jump-cut at line of scrimmage to change gaps and avoid tacklers. Has an effective spin move to make defenders miss in open field. Great agility and plus balance hurdling opponents diving at his legs. Feet keep moving in tight spaces, probing for daylight. Able to consistently beat college defenders to flank. Loves to run over the tackles. Shows ability to create for himself and has burst and agility to turn small gain into big one. Improved as a pass-catcher over second half of the 2014 season.","Desires to bounce runs wide too often. Not as trusting of blocking from B-gap to B-gap. Held to ""stuffs"" -- runs resulting in no yards or a loss -- on 19.2 percent of his carries. Feel and instincts as interior runner need improvement. Shows indecisiveness as one-cut runner. Would gear down and stutter-step to line, waiting for crease to show itself rather than adjusting on fly and taking what was available. Play strength through hole was only average. Used speed over strength to create many missed or broken tackles. Benefited from gaping running lanes. Ball security was an issue. Fumbled six times over his final five games, often being stripped while finishing run. Uncomfortable pass-catcher with marginal hands. Either dropped, double caught or smothered many throws. Pass protection needs work. Might have to come off field on third downs.",WISCONSIN,15,RB,Los Angeles Chargers,2015
Todd Gurley,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/todd-gurley/32004755-5200-0000-f496-e727c8f2225d,"The rehab work and NFL Scouting Combine medicals will be extremely important for Gurley's draft stock as teams assess his potential durability as an NFL running back. He played less than 40 percent of his team's offensive snaps over the last three years, so there is plenty of tread still on the tires. Has the talent to be a top-five NFL running back, but ACL tear clouds the short-term picture.","Rare blend of speed and power. Immense power in legs and shows balance through contact. Shreds arm tackles and has speed to house it. Very hard to tackle on an angle. Professional, decisive runner. Presses line of scrimmage to set up his cut-back runs. Gets downhill with knee bend and forward lean, staying small through the hole. Uses quick, tight steps to second level. Will sink and explode into tackler or side-step and jet, causing hesitation in downhill safeties with their approach. Converts ""speed to power"" between tackles and around corner. Rarely looks to run out of bounds and finishes his runs. Able to factor out of the backfield with soft hands and ability to adjust to throws. In 2014, churned out an amazing 61.9 percent of his rushing yardage after contact. Strong hands and carries ball tight to his body. Only three fumbles in 510 carries.",Missed three games in 2013 due to ankle injury and tore his ACL in 2014. Questions about whether he'll return back to his play speed are a big concern. Vision is average. Still gaining feel as a zone runner. Too locked into looking for cutback lanes when play-side run is open. Can get better at setting up blockers in space. Average creativity in tight quarters. Patience and tempo as a runner can improve. Quick passing attack limited his protection opportunities but was very average when given the shot.,GEORGIA,10,RB,Los Angeles Rams,2015
Tevin Coleman,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tevin-coleman/3200434f-4c35-9050-eb7e-20c726e53f5b,"His violent running style is a joy to watch, but might have to be tempered to extend his career. He is a ""race car in the red"" on just about every snap and refuses to give in, which leads to many big runs. Zone, gap, power ... it doesn't really matter because Coleman can fit all schemes. Has the burst and top-end speed to be a game-changing running back for a team looking for a workhorse.","Decisive north-south runner. Outstanding three-step burst into second level. Fearless between the tackles. Has dangerous jump-cut to instantly change gaps and ruin the plans of linebackers. Stays square to the line and is always in ready position to hit turbo. Fluid and flexible lower body with elite one-cut ability and natural change-of-direction talent without gearing down. Power in legs to slice through arm tackles and uses free hand as quality stiff-arm. Violent run finisher. Will duck shoulder and throw heavy forearm into tackler to prove a point. Not a content runner -- keeps feet moving after contact and won't give in. Capable hands out of backfield and willing to square up and engage pass rushers on pass plays. Hits top speed so quickly that safeties and linebackers repeatedly take poor angles, leading to long touchdowns. Half of his 28 career rushing touchdowns were of 43-plus yards, including eight of 64-plus yards.","Treats every carry like a sprint. Must improve run tempo and patience on stretch plays. Has to learn when to keep run play-side and improve patience so he allows back-side cutback lanes to develop. Can improve out of backfield. Wasn't always in position to scan defense on screen passes, resulting in lost yardage. Pad level often a little high into contact.",INDIANA,73,RB,Atlanta Falcons,2015
Ameer Abdullah,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ameer-abdullah/32004142-4464-7726-b649-e09413abd27c,"Despite having first-round talent, Abdullah's lack of preferred NFL size and issues with ball security might cause some teams to shy away from him in the opening round. Abdullah has explosive potential as a runner and ball-catcher and is a natural zone-scheme fit. His high character will make him a hit during interview process.",Decisive runner with good lower-body drive and a willingness to run behind his pads. Finishes his runs. Has NFL-caliber burst and can hit top speed quickly. Defenses must respect his ability to turn the corner on play-side. Patient runner with plus vision. Willing to seek out cutback lanes. Rarely dances to the line or makes unnecessary lateral moves. Isn't a predictable runner. Lacks blazing top-end speed but plays fast. Highly competitive with a high football IQ. Hasn't dropped a pass in two years and can be a valuable weapon in passing attack. Will make arm tacklers pay and is better in short yardage than most backs his size. Can help immediately as a punt or kick returner. Personal and football character is considered off-the-charts by the scouting community.,Lacks ideal size that teams look for from a three-down running back. Frame is close to maxed out. Doesn't always go through his pass routes at full speed. Smallish frame causes some issues in pass protection. Tenacity in protection needs to improve. Ball security is a legitimate concern with 13 fumbles over his four years at Nebraska.,NEBRASKA,54,RB,Detroit Lions,2015
Jay Ajayi,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jay-ajayi/3200414a-4177-1256-2431-b2af057c0b9d,"While the comparison to Marshawn Lynch might be a little much considering Lynch's exploits in the NFL, Ajayi's running style and body type are very similar to Lynch's and Ajayi features an improving stiff arm and physicality that has become Lynch's calling card. Ajayi has the ability to play all three downs while mashing in short yardage and near the goal line. Scouts have been quietly circling Ajayi as a second-tier running back who offers tremendous value on the second day (Rounds 2-3) of the draft.","Good size and great feet. Former soccer player with sudden feet. Able to string together multiple moves at a time. Varies speeds as a runner and can call on second gear when he sees daylight. Hips and feet always in sync thanks to soccer background. Shows enough wiggle to make defenders miss and can create and improvise if creases aren't offering much. Runs with wide base and generates leg drive to push. Plays with bend and bursts through the hole with low pad level. Reliable yards-after-contact back. Accelerates into contact on second level. True weapon out of backfield with adequate hands and good feel for maximizing each catch in space. Twists and turns and fights to fall forward. Asked to be physical, downhill runner between tackles and he obliged. Shows good blitz recognition. Showed mental toughness and character, coming back from deep in the doghouse for October 2011 arrest.",Gets too cute at times looking to sift laterally from gap to gap as he approaches line of scrimmage. Needs to run with more urgency to perimeter. Can get out-flanked when opportunity to turn corner was previously available. Average feel through the hole. Runs into defenders he should be able to avoid. Heavy workload in 2014 with 398 total touches (28.4 per game). Ball-security concerns with 11 fumbles over last 597 carries. Pass-protection technique needs improvement. Tore his ACL in 2011. Was arrested for stealing sweatpants in 2011 and faced long road of severe punishment from then-coach Chris Petersen.,BOISE STATE,141,RB,Miami Dolphins,2015
Duke Johnson,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/duke-johnson/32004a4f-4800-0009-3d52-7d0c4c49cdd8,"One of the most explosive runners in college football during his time at Miami, Johnson doesn't need much of a crease to make defenses pay. His explosive quickness and elusiveness should help him adapt quickly to NFL speed and his feel and courage as a one-cut runner should earn him instant playing time. Johnson's lack of protection skills and his injury concerns could force him into a committee situation.","Explosive burst and plays with suddenness. Elusive in tight quarters. Has lightning in his feet. Has hips and feet to stop and start without stalling. Rare ability on stretch plays to hit cutback lanes that other backs can't get to. Runs with patience and a well-timed burst. Has great feel as zone-scheme, one-cut runner. Changes direction without breaking stride. Courageous runner. Shows no fear when getting downhill. Strong-willed competitor with toughness. Has second gear around the corner and can erase the angles. Gets small(er) through the hole and runs behind pads. Fights through arm tackles. Regroups and balances himself after initial contact. Reads and sets up routes and adjusts to poorly thrown balls.","Average inside runner, where feel and instincts are concerned. Vision fails him at times when running between the tackles. Won't always see initial hole and will mash turbo button, hoping to power through to second level. At times unwilling to do dirty work in pass protection. Looks for cut blocks rather than squaring up and playing with technique and toughness. Tries to run to daylight once in open field rather than just finishing runs. Hampered by injuries in 2014 and broke his ankle in 2013. Medicals will be combed over. Must improve ball security after fumbling six times over last two seasons.",MIAMI,77,RB,Cleveland Browns,2015
T.J. Yeldon,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/t-j-yeldon/32005945-4c06-0186-cd0f-a93c74a0d6a6,"Instinctive, athletic running back who has the foot quickness to create for himself when lanes constrict or blocks are missed. Yeldon lacks the ball security, top-end speed and desired tackle breaking to be a full-time starter. He's a versatile, rotational back with the ability to step in and step up.","Has good size with room on his frame to add more bulk. Exceptional hips and foot quickness, using both to weave and dart through the trash between tackles. Quick, decisive reads on zone plays. Has ankle flexion to dip, one-cut and burst through second level and into the third. Creative runner showing innate feel for running lanes. Anticipates creases that are developing and makes himself skinny to squeeze through. Effortless lateral movement. Can make tacklers miss and change tackle angles in confined quarters. Above average out of backfield and after the catch. Productive when playing through pain.","Upright runner in space, opening himself and the ball up to big hits. Pad level too high at point of collision. Mediocre power for size. Doesn't push the pile and won't run through many tackles. Pass protection lacking. Throws shoulder at pass rusher rather than squaring up and taking on with good posture. Tends to bounce and juke a little too long at the second level. Must improve ball security after fumbling 10 times over 576 career carries.",ALABAMA,36,RB,Jacksonville Jaguars,2015
Cameron Artis-Payne,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cameron-artis-payne/32004152-5438-7205-b9ec-41e76cfc932f,"Doesn't have much tread off the tires since arriving to Auburn from junior college. Has proven that he can hit the turbo button and get through creases, but lacks special traits and ability to max out carries. Artis-Payne is a tough runner but I question if he has enough athleticism to be anything more than a grinder and average backup.","Patient runner who waits for blocks to develop before attacking the hole. Will duck his head and finish a run. Short-stepper who gets to top speed quickly. Looks to keep the runs north and south. Effective spin move on second level. Good ball security. Due to stocky frame, defenders underestimate his burst around the corner and tend to take poor angles on him. Willing banger between tackles.",Patience sometimes turns into a lack of urgency with reads. Thickly built but doesn't move piles as often as expected. One note runner. Tight hips and without much wiggle in open space. Must improve in protection. Might not have enough juice to be able to threaten the edge as an NFL runner.,AUBURN,166,RB,Carolina Panthers,2015
David Cobb,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/david-cobb/3200434f-4214-1451-fb68-cb1e508304a2,"Cobb's YouTube highlights might bore you, but he's custom-made for physical running teams. He has one-cut traits and can play in a gap scheme. Adjusting his style to the speed of the NFL game might take some time, but Cobb's downhill, run-finishing style fits what running games are becoming again and he has a shot to be more than just a complementary back.","Powerful, compact runner with a low center of gravity. Efficient and decisive. Makes defenders miss with slight movement and hand usage. Won't succumb to arm tackles. Gained 54 percent of his yardage after contact from 2013-2014. Patient runner who gets the most from his runs. Has good speed in open field for a back his size. Balance is his friend. Smooth change-of-direction with little wasted motion. Gets low and finishes with leg drive. When he smells the end zone, he wants to eat.",Average improviser. Not a stop/start runner and lacks dynamic qualities. Gets yards on his plate and what he grinds for after contact. Lacks lateral quickness to bounce runs outside with consistent success in the NFL. Fumbled in four of six games in the middle of the 2014 season. Needs more commitment to pass protection. Average hands as a receiver. Needs extended runway to ramp up to top speed.,MINNESOTA,130,RB,Tennessee Titans,2015
Mike Davis,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mike-davis/32004441-5656-7050-90fa-b554877db5f4,"Rhythm runner who is at his best when he's getting plenty of work. Davis has a surprising ability to turn on the jets and get on top of the secondary quickly for long runs, and his north-south mentality is a fit for the pros. With an ability to play on third down as well, the only thing holding Davis back is conditioning. Davis won't make too many defenders miss, so he can't afford to lose the corner speed he showed in 2013. Davis can be a very capable NFL backup with the potential to become a starter.",Compact frame with plus balance as a runner. Keeps feet moving in traffic and can pinball from defender to defender. Uses spin move effectively to avoid the hit and keep running. Will duck head and accelerate behind his pads with force to finish his runs. Downhill runner near the end zone with adequate push to grind out the extra half yard needed. Creates separation to the perimeter with quality stiff arm and showed surprising top-end speed to hit the long run in 2013. Gets adequate separation out of backfield and can convert the catch into a first down. Capable in pass protection with understanding of protections.,"Has some hip tightness, which limits his lateral movement. Won't make defender miss with wiggle or juke, and struggles to create when his track is closed. Will duck his head prematurely heading into hole at times, and briefly loses his vision and feel for the hole, often running into the backs of blockers. Showed substantially more juice as a runner in 2013. Conditioning looked off and he was sluggish to the perimeter and through the line of scrimmage in 2014. Relatively ineffective toward end of the year. The 2014 tape shows energy lacking for Davis compared to 2013.",SOUTH CAROLINA,123,RB,San Francisco 49ers,2015
Javorius Allen,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/javorius-allen/3200414c-4c46-9092-5c78-2e9c81c3e122,"Workhorse back able to make plays late in the game and work out of the backfield to keep defenses honest. His relative elusiveness in space and ability to cut on a dime give him the ability to create yards where there are none, but his average vision and inability to finish off runs will keep him from getting some of the yards teams might expect. He's well-rounded enough to be a very good backup with middle-
of-the-road starting potential.","Loose hips for tight turns and razor-sharp cuts. Has quick-stop, jump-cut ability to make defenders miss in the backfield. Can slalom back and forth, navigating around traffic through the line of scrimmage and into the second level. Able to shake linebackers and downhill safeties in space. Short-area acceleration to give leg-tacklers a vanishing target. Has lateral quickness to bounce runs outside and create something out of nothing. Factors into passing game, averaging 11.3 yards per catch over last two seasons. Plays with adequate burst through the crease. Able to handle a heavy workload if asked.","Running style doesn't match his size. Upright runner. Plays with high pad level and doesn't finish runs with attitude and urgency. Slows feet into contact and rarely explodes through initial tackler with force. Lacks instincts and feel for developing running lanes. Chooses the trafficked path more than expected. At times, will show some indecisiveness and hesitation into the fray. Will break prematurely from path the play should follow rather than allowing it to develop. Focus drops plagued him out of backfield in 2014.",USC,122,RB,Baltimore Ravens,2015
David Johnson,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/david-johnson/32004a4f-4817-4477-4e5f-db6fb5a95abe,"Johnson lacks the short-area quickness to be a consistently effective every-down running back, but he has good size, speed and hands so he can't just be dismissed. He doesn't run routes well enough and isn't sudden enough to be a wide receiver, so he might have to be a third-down back with kick-return potential.",Looks good on the hoof. Possesses a big body and falls forward for additional yards. Smooth pass-catcher out of the backfield and is a mismatch for linebackers. Has been a consistent weapon out of the backfield while in college. Uses an effective jump cut on inside runs to change direction and can string a couple of them together on the same run. Has good long speed when he gets into space.,Long-strider. Doesn't always look like he has the foot quickness to burst through the hole consistently. Allows defenders to get a hand on him through the replace and isn't a classic finisher. Tends to hit the brakes too hard in order to make his cuts. Questionable vision. Looks to make cuts instead of keeping the run play-side. Scouts want to see more fire in his play demeanor. Play strength and blocking are problems. Goes down too easily.,NORTHERN IOWA,86,RB,Arizona Cardinals,2015
Matt Jones,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/matt-jones/32004a4f-4e60-3219-485e-36655170f13d,"Has very good athleticism for a big running back and is a physical pile-mover who is difficult to stop for negative yardage. Unfortunately, Jones lacks the instincts and vision to fully maximize his physical tools. Jones could become the physical member of a running-back-by-committee approach, with upside as a third-down option.","Imposing size with muscular frame. Above-average swivel in hips and perimeter quickness for runner his size. Pistons for feet, chomping and churning through contact to extend run. Has slippery lower body with angle-tackle attempts sliding off. Keeps shoulders square to line for maximum power. Plays with forward lean and is difficult to stop for a loss. Used sparingly as a pass-catcher, but flashes capable hands if asked to do so in the pros. Aggressive in protection, squaring up and striking a blow against free-running blitzer.","More grinder than every-down running back. Will hit it downhill, but has very little feel for maximizing run creases. Blind to open running lanes. Drops head and burrows into blockers and defenders rather than seeing open space. Must improve patience in setting up blocks. Can juke and shift when headed to line of scrimmage, but doesn't show much creativity and shiftiness once he's on second level. Needs to keep ball tucked and secured to avoid fumbling issues.",FLORIDA,95,RB,Washington Commanders,2015
Jeremy Langford,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeremy-langford/32004c41-4e55-0009-7df2-5868ebab3d73,"Langford showed improvement from 2013 to 2014, but he doesn't accelerate through contact and will usually get what is blocked. Without an ability to maximize his yards with each carry, teams could peg him as a ""committee back"" with an ability to play on third downs.","Running back who has played wide receiver and cornerback at Michigan State. Improved a great deal since 2013 season. Has feet to avoid the trash and bounce it outside. Has burst around the corner and can separate from linebackers in pursuit. Finished his 2014 campaign with 22 carries of 15-plus yards, placing him fifth in running-back heavy Big Ten. Effective with chip blocks and will square up blitzers and take them on in pass protection. Has blocking and pass-catching talent to play on third downs. Good spin move and plus lateral foot quickness. Maintains balance through contact. Showed special-teams potential as a sophomore.","Not a physical runner. Broke very few tackles this year and churned out pedestrian yards after contact. Gains extra yards by sliding laterally out of tackles rather than leg churn. Lacks commitment between the tackles. Seems content to absorb hits rather than dish them out. Scouts believe he will be a ""bouncer"" in pros, looking to take runs outside prematurely. Has burst, but not as much wiggle as anticipated.",MICHIGAN STATE,103,RB,Chicago Bears,2015
Marcus Murphy,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/marcus-murphy/32004d55-5251-7528-c408-6a8d935ecd3b,"All-purpose running back with a lean frame and a big heart. Showed consistency of effort and production during his time at Missouri. His value as a runner is limited due to his size, but he has the potential to become a legitimate target out of the backfield and might warrant some reps in camp as a slot receiver. Murphy can step in and immediately challenge for the top spot as a kickoff and/or punt returner.","Has the foot quickness and acceleration to make something out of nothing when called upon as a runner. Needs to play in space, but has quality traits for a runner, despite size. Has enough speed to turn the corner and hit a big run down the sideline. In passing game, mismatches inside 'backers with razor-sharp cuts to the sideline, creating easy throws for the quarterback. Looks to adjust his routes over the top of coverage if quarterback scrambles. Has excellent hands and concentration to finish a catch despite impending contact. Celebrated kick- and punt-return specialist with seven career return touchdowns at Missouri.","Needs to improve his reads and feel on stretch plays flowing outside. Small running back with limited amount of carries he can offer in a given game. Tends to float in space as a receiver rather than working back to the ball. Doesn't make the sharp, downhill cuts expected from him as a running back. Missed 2011 with a shoulder injury. He tries to get in the way as a pass blocker, but lacks bulk and strength to be trusted with blitz pickup on next level.",MISSOURI,205,RB,New Orleans Saints,2015
Karlos Williams,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/karlos-williams/32005749-4c39-8250-3203-7c4584bc633d,"Williams is a big, talented athlete who is still finding his way as a running back. He seemed almost content to lose his job in 2014 and teams will be turning over every rock looking for information on his character. As a one-cut runner with exceptional burst and rare physical traits, Williams could become a very good starter in a zone-based scheme, but his floor is very low based on character and scheme fit.","Former safety with aggressive, physical temperament. Taller and longer than most running backs, but has exceptional burst to trim the corner and go. Angular running style. Makes subtle changes of direction without gearing down. One-cut daddy on outside zone plays. Has good top-end speed. Can be a factor on swing passes and will body up in pass protection. Lowers pads and delivers a blow on the move. Falls forward and is a pile mover when pad level is right. Natural footwork for an inexperienced back. Slams it between tackles when asked and doesn't look to bounce outside. Shows patience and uses head fakes to freeze defenders in space. Hard to tackle and keeps feet churning at impact.","Upright runner. Has issues playing with leverage when challenged suddenly in the hole. Needs to see contact coming to get pads low enough. Has just two years of running back experience. Instincts and feel are very hit and miss. Runs himself into trouble and might not fit all running schemes. Doesn't make many defenders miss on second level. ""Explosive Rushes"" (15-plus yards) fell off substantially in 2014. Gained additional weight preseason, which appears to have slowed him. Lost starting job to freshman. Was investigated by Tallahassee police in domestic battery case, but no charges were filed. Character will be combed over carefully.",FLORIDA STATE,147,RB,Buffalo Bills,2015
Josh Robinson,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/josh-robinson/3200524f-4259-0769-ff79-05ec4b6720ae,Compact running back with squatty lower body and a short-striding style that allows him to get to his top speed quickly in the open field. Robinson appears to be lacking an NFL burst and the shiftiness needed to create more yardage for himself on the second level. He has good short-area footwork and is effective as a pass-catcher but is lacking a differentiating talent from the rest of the backs in this draft.,"Built low to the ground with power trunk and thick bubble. Coils into a ball at contact, making him immune to shoulder and/or forearm blows to tackle. Patient runner. Runs with consistent balance and can maintain it through contact. Flashes lateral agility to escape from the side door and bounce a run wide. Steady threat out of the backfield as pass-catcher. Soft hands to secure the throw and is ready to run after catch. Can chop pass rusher down with his cut blocks.","Vision is average to below average, and will leave some yards on the field. Gets what is blocked and relies on his short-area footwork to make tacklers miss rather than true elusiveness in open area. One-note runner with tightly bundled hips and marginal athleticism. Nothing special with burst through hole, as defenders frequently get their hands on him to slow his progress. Benefited from zone-read system with dual-threat quarterback creating consistent running lanes over tackle. Feet barely leave ground, opening Robinson up to ankle tackles.",MISSISSIPPI STATE,189,RB,Indianapolis Colts,2015
Kenny Hilliard,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kenny-hilliard/32004849-4c71-9831-c364-d5ae91d8774f,Lacks elusiveness and doesn't carry enough power behind his pads to create any intrigue. Couldn't even get to 100 carries in a single season while in college and unlikely to be able to break into rotation in the pros.,Decent top-end speed and can catch the ball well out of the backfield. Finds open spaces in passing game and sets up blocks after the catch. Doesn't dance to the line and finishes off runs falling forward. Play speed is adequate but could improve if carrying less weight.,Doesn't show feel to create if initial running lane is restricted. Burst is absent out of breaks or cuts. Can't shake defender on second level or in open space. Isn't very difficult to bring down for a back his size. Effort to fool defense on play fakes is substandard. Poor technique in pass protection -- lunger with ducked head.,LSU,210,RB,Houston Texans,2015
Joey Iosefa,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/joey-iosefa/3200494f-5317-7981-243b-b3fe47c0d5d1,"One-speed running back with some weight behind his pads, but not enough explosive power to offset his lack of burst and overall athleticism. Could struggle to find a home as an NFL running back and might need to take a look at playing fullback.","No-nonsense runner who prefers to rush between the tackles. Will coil his hips and deliver a blow into second-level linebackers attempting to tackle him and pass rushers in pass protection. Often leans shoulder into contact, absorbing blow while resetting feet to continue his run. Functional ability to cut and take it downhill. Can catch the ball out of the backfield and is adequate in pass protection.","Bulky, but unathletic build. Shows below-average foot quickness, which limits ability to run to perimeter and to make defenders miss in space. Has marginal burst through line of scrimmage, forcing him to deal with consistent traffic around him. Doesn't possess ground-floor acceleration or wiggle to make consistent yardage in screen game.",HAWAII,206,RB,Tampa Bay Buccaneers,2015
Ezekiel Elliott,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ezekiel-elliott/3200454c-4c28-9284-cdcc-74694c8d1749,"Elite, three­-down running back who has the ability to excel in every facet of the game. Elliott has rare combination of size, athleticism, pass-catching and blocking skills and his competitive nature is always bubbling on the surface. While he's had to handle a heavy workload over the last two seasons, Elliot should still come out of the gates as one of the most productive young running backs in the league.","Elite combination of vision and decisiveness. Instinctive, short strider with instant reaction time. Has a bona fide jump-­cut to elude penetration in the backfield and enough burst to elude chasers when he bounces runs to the outside. Able to change directions with no hesitation or wasted motion and is always headed forward. Has innate feel for developing blocks in space and is excellent at setting his blocks up and accelerating from behind them when the linebacker is trapped. When it's gridlocked inside, finds yards on his own. Rocked up physique but still maintains loose hips for agility. Exceptional balance through contact and takes tacklers for a ride. Has a ""come at me, bro!"" mentality as a runner. Loves to end runs on his physical terms. Uses lead shoulder as a weapon, but plays with outstanding ball security. Looks to absolutely bludgeon defenders as a lead blocker and is often successful. Able pass catcher who adjusts to throws and can do something with it after the catch.","Strapped it up with a heavy workload over last two seasons including over 600 touches. Defenders land big shots on him. Appears to be too willing to put himself through the meat grinder rather than avoiding certain collisions. Understanding when to attack and when to elude may take time for him. Can sharpen his pass routes a bit and has room for improvement as a pass blocker. On second level, gets on top of defenders before he has a chance to gather himself into a position to evade a tackle.

Henry's long legs and angular running style is a much better fit for downhill running teams who value lead backs and physicality. Henry needs early running room as he's not a creator in the backfield, but once he gets up a full head of steam, he is a nightmare with his ability to punish on the second and third level or take it to the house. Henry should come in and provide immediate production as a starter.","One of the biggest running backs you will ever see. Can be a violent runner without even trying. Pummels tacklers with forward lean and dynamite behind his pads. Gives run-­support cornerbacks bad dreams. Rare top­-end speed for a runner his size. Long strides from second to third level cut into reaction time for safeties and often leave them a step short and grasping for air. Effective in zone, gap and power schemes. Rarely fatigues and wears down defenses as game goes on. Had 29.6 percent of his explosive carries come in the fourth quarter. Makes consistent, initial reads as a zone runner. Against 
Mississippi State, took outside zone run and cut it all the way back across formation out­racing defense for 65-yard touchdown. Led nation in missed tackles forced with 60. Uses subtle change of direction on the second level  while keeping runs north/south. Used as a possession bully in short yardage spots and when Alabama wanted to impose their will.","With almost 400 touches this year, scouts are concerned about his workload. Averaged almost 32 carries against SEC competition including 90 carries over his final two regular season games. Tall, long-strider who takes time to build up his speed. Average foot quickness can lead to tackles for losses if he gets too cute in the backfield. Needs to improve his second read as a zone runner. Ineffective in passing game with below average hands. Narrow based running style allows defenders to trip him up. More run­-finisher 
than tackle breaker with just seven broken tackles to Leonard Fournette's 22. Sluggish cut­back ability once he's outside the tackle box.",ALABAMA,46,RB,Tennessee Titans,2016

If he can stay healthy, Howard has the ability to become an instant factor as an NFL starter.","Showed ability to step his game up against top competition at both UAB and Indiana. Rushed for at least 145 yards in every full game he played. Natural runner who combines tempo with a special feel for spacial relationships. Pro­-ready vision gives him outstanding feel for run lane developments at the line of scrimmage and onto the second level. Consistently chooses best angles and creases for optimal yardage. For a big back, can make himself skinny through tight quarters. Decisive and punishing. Drops pads and accelerates into contact to batter would-­be tacklers on the second and third levels. Drives legs through arm tackles and goes about his work. Hard-­charging when it’s third- or fourth-and-short. Showed potential in screen game as receiver.",Doesn't have sudden one-­cut ability and has to tap brakes to hit it downhill on outside zone runs. One-speed runner. Can be chased down by backside sprinters before getting to the second level. Takes big hits due to bruising running style. Scouts concerned about ability to stay healthy. Missed four games and parts of three others with knee and ankle injuries. Upright pads and narrow base leads to slips and balance issues when trying to make sharp cuts.

Booker is a three-down running back who has the toughness and determination to grind out short yardage while possessing the vision and footwork to create for himself when near the line of scrimmage or the second level. Booker isn’t fast, but he plays at a consistent speed and should have enough quickness to be consistently productive as an NFL starting running back.","Patient runner but decisive when he sees the crease. Hits it through the crease with determination. Flashes above-average feel for the way running lanes shift and change, and he flows with it making the smart choices to avoid tacklers and extend runs. Features excellent vision. Doesn’t get caught dancing very often and usually ends the run on his terms with low pads and forward lean. Can maintain play speed when changing direction and cutting. Has crisp footwork approaching the line of scrimmage and can dodge and dart around penetration to create yardage opportunities. Elusive second-level runner able to string together a slew of moves in succession. Effective pass catcher with soft hands. Rarely leaves the field. Dependable short yardage back in college. Willing to step up and do his part in pass protection.","Doesn’t have the top­-end speed to be a “chunk play” runner. Full­-time running back, but on the borderline of size NFL teams look for from a full-­time back. May not be able to add more weight onto his frame without compromising quickness and his average speed. Cut down on his fumbles this season but had six last year which could be a potential concern at the NFL level.

Vision and footwork are the catalysts for his elusiveness and he has flashed long speed. Collins is a repetitive runner lacking dynamic talent, but he's run in gap, power and zone schemes and should be a scheme fit for most teams looking at running back. Collins should be able to step right in and challenge for carries and red zone work immediately.","Well-built, durable frame with feet from a wind­up toy. Plays with amazingly consistent and repetitive tempo as a runner. Able to weave in, out and around traffic without breaking his speed or tempo. Has foot quickness and agility to avoid the backfield traffic and the instant acceleration to get the run back underway. Patient and probing while waiting for a crease. Pad level and knee bend are outstanding. Keeps shoulders square to the line and stays low and tight through the hole. Excellent vision on the interior and consistently jukes and side­steps tackle attempts to create additional yardage. Touchdown hog. Plated 32 rushing touchdowns over last three years. Runs with consistent forward lean and always falls forward.","One speed runner. Doesn't play with natural one-­cut stride length and everything comes off stutter-stepping, choppy strides. Feel for outside runs is off. Breaks runs back inside prematurely that still have life along their original track. Can't generate enough momentum through contact acceleration to be a tackle breaker. Credited with just five broken tackles over his last 475 carries. Unproven as pass catcher and inconsistent in squaring up his pass protection responsibilities.

Dixon possesses outstanding feet with exciting suddenness in his change of direction, but he’s very willing to finish his runs with authority and has a knack for finding the endzone. Dixon has all the traits of being a quality, three­-down starter in the NFL but his frame and suspect pass protection could be long-term concerns.","Hungry runner who almost never gives in to the defender. Light on his feet using outstanding jump ­cut and lateral quickness to sidestep danger in the backfield and create a positive play. Elusiveness on second level often leaves tacklers grasping at air. Able to string moves together and hit the explosive play. Despite being keyed on, still creates yardage for himself. Determined and competitive. Accelerates through initial contact and squeezes carries for everything he can. Averaged almost twice as many yards per carry after first contact (3.3) than before first contact (1.7). Greedy eater when endzone in his sights with 39 rushing touchdowns since 2014. Quick recognition of defensive flow and adjusts running lanes accordingly. Decisive runner with plus burst and ability to charge it up to his top speed instantly. Has very 
good feel for running lanes and tacklers and is able to navigate both without much wasted movement. Violent finisher for his size and enjoys thumping corners and safeties. Reliable pass catcher who can hurt teams out of the backfield.",Very average thickness through lower half. Struggled with a knee injury in 2013 and missed two games in 2015 with an ankle injury. Physical running style could lead to durability concerns. Not as likely to slip out of side doors against substantially better competition. Average long speed makes him more slasher than home-run hitter. Competitive resolve leads him to try and do too much on some snaps. Base narrows in space and can be susceptible to shoestring tackles. Aggression and competitiveness as a runner isn’t as readily available in pass protection. Needs to improve ball security.

While Perkins' tape is full of ankle-breaking cuts, his draft value will also be determined by his ability to protect the quarterback and stay on the field in short-yardage spots. If Perkins finds the right scheme and team fits for his talents, he could become a high-­end committee back early on.","One of the top creators in the draft combining elite vision and a wicked jump­-cut. Can disappear before tackler's eyes and put them on his highlight reel. Shows no directional tendencies with his cuts and can make defenders miss in tight quarters. Decisive when working between the tackles, but can bounce it when warranted. Flashes sudden, 1­-cut ability on stretch plays. Stacks moves on moves. Reliable hands when asked to help in passing game. Willing to stick his nose in against the blitz.","Smallish frame for the big-­boy workload asked of him. Arm tackle attempts cause hiccup in his journey. Runs halted abruptly when tacklers square him up. Could be forced off field in short yardage spots. Missing NFL-­caliber force to run through contact and fall forward.

Prosise looks like an immediate ""committee"" runner with future starter potential.","Has every­-down size for the position. Patient, gliding runner with a sense for when it's time to hit the gas and go. Has late cut ability to create new yards for himself. Has effective open-field spin move to elude and the play strength to power through lesser tackle attempts. Efficient runner between the tackles. Runs with desired pad level maintains balance through contact. Falls forward in his finishing. Has enough play speed to turn the corner as outside runner. Experience as receiver gives him upgraded route ability as running back. Has opportunity to be effective on all three levels as receiver if matchup avails itself.","Only one year as full-­time running back. Urgency as runner needs an upgrade. Can be slowed waiting for zone-­read mesh­-point, but indecisiveness flowing outside caused some lost yardage. Fumbled five times in 156 carries losing two.

Williams' physicals at the combine will be huge since teams are justifiably concerned when the long term health of running backs who sustain foot injuries.","Loose hips and quick feet are his calling card. Crafty with outstanding lateral movement to side­step tacklers in the backfield, in the hole and on the second level. Light feet allow for immediate actions and reactions when needed.

Limited tread ­wear with just 406 carries at Arkansas. Sets up his blocks well and runs with good balance through contact and an ability to run through arm tackles. Played in physical running game and will finish runs stronger than most slashing backs. Dependable in short yardage with the fortitude for short yardage situations. Three-down running back with soft hands out of the backfield. Willing to do his part in pass protection.","Needs to play with consistent burst and decisiveness. Spoiled between massive Arkansas offensive line that blew open gaping lanes that he won't see in the pros. Against Georgia (2014), made bad decisions to break inside runs outside because lanes were tighter than usual. At times, got too cute in the hole rather than planting and bursting upfield.

Needs to become more comfortable between the tackles. Excellent vision to the perimeter becomes cloudier between the b-gaps. Will duck head and finish a run prematurely rather than probing for more interior space. Not always small through the crease. Flashes ability to finish with authority but makes business decisions at times. Hips not as fluid as expected. Would benefit from use of a hearty stiff-arm. Inconsistent hands in all phases. Ball security issues with 13 career fumbles. Suffers from focus drops out of backfield.

Will open creases by varying pace of his runs. Burst to top speed is available at flip of a switch. Creates yardage with speed, wiggle and power. Twitchy and decisive. Strong lower body provides superior balance. Flexible and agile with ability to twist, spin and ricochet off of bodies and continue to gain yards after contact. Very productive; 23 touchdowns in just 284 touches at Tennessee. Well-liked inside program and a team leader. Can play on all three downs. Improved in pass protection and squares up blitzers.

Can shake tacklers, but lacks a twitchy burst to accelerate away after the cut. On stretch plays, can get too cute continuing to probe towards the perimeter rather than choosing a crease and committing. Average burst may not be enough to race past NFL speed on second level.

His draft slot will likely be impacted by his domestic violence issue. Mixon has the talent to be an every-down, all-day running back with the potential to take over a game on the ground or through the air. Life against weaker Big 12 defenses has created a more relaxed rushing approach for Mixon who will have to play at a faster pace as an NFL back. Mixon's vision is just average and he could struggle to create for himself in front of a subpar offensive line; however, he can play in any rushing scheme and can be moved all over the field as a matchup option.",Outstanding burst to go from first level to third level.

Can be too patient at times. Looks for wide-open points of entry before he hits the gas. Can be nonchalant approaching line of scrimmage. Dances downhill allowing running lanes to become creases. Feet lag behind when headed into congestion and will get loose with his rush track inviting tacklers a chance to get a hand on him. Lacks creativity in initial stages of his run at times.

Foreman has outstanding foot quickness and wiggle for a back his size, but will need to run behind his pads and with more aggression on the next level. Teams could be split on his draft value as some may covet his size and athleticism while others will be concerned about a lack of third down value. Ultimately he has the talent to be a good NFL starter, but he's still a work in progress.","Outstanding athleticism for a big runner. Smooth lateral movement. Has feet and agility for slide and go cuts from one gap to the next without a noticeable gear down. Finesses run lanes with subtle shifts and turns. Measured stride length optimizes balance. Swivels hips to swerve away from second level linebackers. Can hurdle open field tacklers who try and go low. Play speed is adequate. Has size and balance to pinball from one tackler to the next if he's not wrapped up. Jars linebackers and safeties at impact with his size alone. North-south runner.

Inconsistent acceleration into contact. Waits to churn feet until after blow has landed. One pace runner. Forced into 30 or more carries in six of his last seven games. Needs to press the line a little longer on inside zone carries. Impatient keeping runs play-side and looks to break back inside prematurely. Almost overly committed to original running track rather than being flexible with his reads. Burst is average through the line allowing defenders to get hands on him. Alarming ball security issues this season with seven fumbles and six lost. Poor mechanics in pass protection.

Feel for the rushing lane helps him choose the correct path between the tackles but lacks the burst to turn the 4-yard run into 14. Zone-scheme runner with serviceable hands out of the backfield. Adequate in most areas and has talent to become a backup that can step in and handle a bigger load if needed. ,Compact body with broad frame and muscular legs. Above-average agility for his size. Has hips and feet to elude darting defenders in backfield. Uses effective jump-cut to avoid the sludge and shift to the open gap. Runs with good vision and overall instincts.

Mack has plenty of wiggle to bounce from run lane to run lane and make tacklers miss, but he has a penchant for looking to break runs way outside when the interior becomes too trafficked and he won't be able to get away with that against NFL speed. Mack is a complementary runner who can hit big runs against defenses who have been worn down, but he needs to be matched with the right scheme in order to unlock his big-play potential.",Looks like he has ball bearings in his hips.

Hands showed improvement as pass catcher.,"Runs with inconsistent power through contact. Will need to accelerate through contact on next level. Serial run bouncer. Too willing to make wild bounces to the furthest reaches of the perimeter if interior lanes are gummed up. Lacks a committed approach between the tackles.

He's an electric playmaker who needs touches, but he's too small and unpredictable to handle much of an NFL carry count. Cohen gets easy separation as a receiver out of the backfield or from the slot and he will likely be used as an updated version of Darren Sproles 2.0.","Nicknamed ""The Human Joystick"" for his ability to make seemingly impossible cuts.

Slaloms through traffic from side to side with seamless, tight jump cuts. Keeps tight track through the gaps, maintaining distance from defensive linemen. Able to string moves together. Razor-sharp cutbacks at challenging angles are his thing. Made a rare 90-degree cut out of a downhill run against South Alabama. Excels in outside zone but has courage to stick it between tackles. Extremely elusive in open field after catch. Used as matchup weapon out of backfield. Good route runner who creates necessary separation.","Undersized. Lacks the leg thickness and overall physical strength desired out of an NFL running back. Spirit is willing but flesh is weak. Arm tackles are able to end his journey. Willing to accelerate into defender, but doesn't have the pop to break tackles or fall forward after contact. Quicker than fast. Will get caught from behind.

On most carries, it feels like Kelley is playing a game of chicken against defenders when he ducks his head and hits the accelerator into contact. He's going to create some yardage after contact and break tackles here and there, but he tends to become a tackle magnet who is not able to make tacklers miss. He's a tough runner with short-yardage ability and maybe even third-down value.

While he has some wiggle and elusiveness, he takes an alarming amount of punishing blows and gets tossed around like a sack of laundry as an inside runner. He will need to pair with a team that utilizes his vision and tempo primarily on stretch plays. His play speed is just average, which hurts him when he becomes too predictable with his choice or rush paths. Huntley runs good routes and could be considered for usage in gadget packages that also take advantage of his ability to work from the slot.","Can splash around as a ball-carrier, pass catcher and kick returner.

Tempo and decisiveness are his calling cards, making him a highly talented inside/outside zone runner. He's a cerebral runner who understands block timing and uses quick-cut agility and rare spatial awareness to read and react to defenses beyond the second level. Swift isn't overly explosive as a home-run hitter and doesn't run with the violence of last year's top running back, Josh Jacobs. He can step right in and provide early stability and production as an efficient, every-down back with Offensive Rookie of the Year potential.","Compact build with strong lower body and three-down talent. Understands blocking schemes and trusts his big guys up front. Reads overflowing linebackers on zone carries making early run-lane adjustments. Rare feel and vision in tight quarters as interior runner. Listens to fluidity of the crease and takes what it gives him. Effective jump-cut allows him to press runs deep into the hole. Tremendous feel for spatial relationship. Maintains balance through twists, turns and contact. Gets right on top of tacklers before cutting. Quick to find acceleration after slowing his feet. Can run expanded route tree and separate out of breaks. Hands are soft and sticky as pass-catcher. Willing to step into pass protection duties and has some dog in him.","Ball security is well below NFL standards, with a low carries-per-fumble mark. Quicker than fast, lacking home-run burst.

Taylor runs with bend and burst as an outside runner and has home-run speed once he gets into the open field. He displays an ability to weave around interior traffic but might have evolved into more of a thinker than reactor inside due to fumbling issues and the litany of loaded fronts he faced. His patience and understanding of the where/when of blocks allowed him to thrive in multiple run schemes. He's more body puncher than knockout artist, wearing down his opponents with carry after carry.

He runs with tempo and flow but alters his rush track at a moment's notice when needed. He is elusive but lacking the instant burst of a slasher capable of stacking long runs in a single game. Akers has above-average open-field vision once he's into the second level and looks to run through the tackler's pads as a finisher. He's a three-down option with good feel for finding the crease near the goal line, but ball security needs to improve. He can be Leg 1 or 2 of a tandem rushing attack and is one of the more natural runners in the draft.","Compact, rocked-up build with powerful legs. Played behind subpar run blocking and often found his own production. Tough finisher who's able to shred arm tackles and balance through contact. Wicked open-field spin move to slip defender. Instinctive runner with good feel for run-lane development. Multiple cuts and run-lane resets without losing momentum. Eyes and feet work in unison. Former high school quarterback with trick play potential. Sudden feet to elude sudden traffic. Nose for the end zone once he's in range. Open-field vision boosts screen-game value.

Edwards-Helaire runs with instinctive eyes and quick-cut foot speed. He doesn't really have tells or tendencies and can alter the rush track when needed, which makes him so unpredictable for defenses. While he can create for himself, he's better off working inside-out as NFL linebackers might be able to outflank him on pure outside runs. He has pop behind his pads but lacks short-yardage size. He has the talent to become a good, three-down back in time, but needs to improve in pass protection.","Ball security is outstanding. Runs low to the ground with superb bend and balance. 36 percent of his carries were for first downs or touchdowns in 2019. Can cut-and-go without stopping anywhere on field. Quick gather and cut agility laterally or on downhill flow. Has spin move, elongated jump cut, and sudden double cut in his bag. Makes tacklers miss in a phone booth.

Proved he could shoulder a heavy load and rise to the occasion against the best his schedule had to offer. He can make a sudden tackler miss and fits as a one-cut runner, but his running style is more battle axe than buzzsaw as a lunch-pail runner with the fortitude and toughness to wear down defenses. Dobbins isn't going to be that creative back with the wiggle and juice to create something out of nothing, but he has the efficiency, production and third-down value teams covet. Dobbins could land a shared-carries role quickly and has the potential to become a solid NFL starter.","Beach body with chiseled, compact build. Big games met with big performances in 2019. Never missed a game and played through pain. Beat on defenses as a high-volume bell-cow in 2019. Steady supply of contact balance to absorb and move forward.

Personnel evaluators for NFL teams say there is wear and tear that could limit the length of his career. He needs to become more discerning with his physical challenges if he wants to see a second contract. He is a great fit for gap and inside, zone-heavy rushing attacks and could become an effective starter as a middle-round pick.",Well-built with power dispersed throughout. Both patient and urgent gears at his disposal. Runs with rare calm in the face of early penetration. Underrated vision to process and game plan beyond the line of scrimmage. Adequate burst inside with feel for the contour of the running lane. Short-stepping running style with elite contact balance. Arm tacklers might want to call in sick. Absorbs contact like a cement truck. Spin moves toss tacklers aside. Drops and squares pads as a finisher. Small space power to move the chains and find the paint. Has ability to handle third down duties if called into action.,Tight hips limit turn radius on first and second level. Additional gather steps before making the cut. Average overall game speed.

Evans is a little undersized and might be viewed as a change-of-pace option, but he appears to have the three-down skill set to handle committee carries. He can run with patience, but has the loose hips and agile feet to plant-and-go in a hurry. He sees the field and does a nice job of setting up and eluding tacklers with lateral cuts or stacked moves. While he's confident in space, Evans lacks the commitment and finishing force to make a living inside the tackles. His third-down and kick-return versatility increases the likelihood that Evans will hear his name called in the middle rounds with a chance to become a solid RB2.","Grabbed larger chunks of production pie in both 2018 and 2019.

Dillon is capable of handling heavy workloads and wearing down defenses, but there is a concern from evaluators that it's taken a physical toll on him. He's a disciplined runner who trusts his blocking scheme and follows his rush track. He's a good one-cut runner with below-average wiggle but natural power to create yards after contact. Dillon will find more space as he faces fewer loaded boxes as a pro, but dropping weight and adding quickness could be the difference between a future as a committee back or starter.","Carries weight easily on big, well-proportioned frame.

He’s a capable inside/outside runner with unique footwork to stack moves and reset pathways, but can plow into tacklers at a moment’s notice using elite contact balance to keep the run rolling. He might need to dial back efforts to search out big runs so frequently and take what is there a little more often to keep from getting bogged down. His pass-catching talent ensures the opportunity for Robinson to see a high number of touches. He has a chance to become one of the more productive runners in the league very quickly.

Richardson is durable enough to handle a season full of carries, and with the new CBA rules putting a ceiling on rookie salaries, it will be tough for teams to pass on such a talented, polished back that will be a franchise back for years to come.","Richardson is as compact and coiled an athlete that the running back position has seen since Adrian Peterson. Richardson is explosive, powerful and balanced, the three most shining traits that are evident when he ran the ball for Alabama. He is a heady and instinctual player who is patient enough to wait for blocks to develop within the scheme and quick enough to change course and cut backfield to daylight. Richardson has a strong core that he uses to break arm tackles and get physical leverage under would-be blockers or blitzers in pass protection. He is a true three-down back who can be effective on screens and out of the backfield catching the ball. Richardson is an ideal height, big enough to remain a force in the power run game, yet small enough to remain elusive and hide behind blocks.","Richardson ran behind a very good, experienced offensive line at Alabama. Nick Saban has brought in so much talent, parlayed with a top-notch, NFL savvy coaching staff, that nearly every position has a top draftable athlete honing it. Mark Ingram won the Heisman a year ago as the best player on the best team, and to some Richardson could be an example of a smart, serviceable player running in a talented offense. Richardson will likely prove that he has the talent to make plays on his own, but much of his production were yards on plays in a good scheme with a seam and an opportunity to get to linebacker and safety level without much trouble.

He had played sparingly in more of a scat back role prior to this year, but showed that he is a true starting tailback who possesses many traits of a first rounder. While there is debate about the risk behind investing an early round selection on a back whose shelf life is short, Miller has put together enough solid tape to garner a late first-round value and should continue to excite and ascend as he displays his athletic ability throughout the pre-draft process.","Miller has track speed and actually ran a few anchor legs for the Miami track team prior to his junior year. Once in the open field, he is a threat to take it the distance and is not only a straight-line, long-speed runner; Miller has even more impressive quickness off the snap and in tight areas to avoid and stay productive. He is very smooth and impressive off the snap as he gets to top speed quickly and is able to pick his spots at full speed in a very effective way. He hardly ever gets stuck in the backfield and is reliable to get positive yardage on each carry. He is a very efficient runner who has a natural feel for maneuvering his way through the box. ","Miller has only one full season of tape and was rather ineffective as a runner prior to this year. He relies on speed and leg drive to gain yards.

He truly runs with his own style, and it's obvious that he has love for the game. He was one of very few limited prospects who played for Team USA prior to enrolling in college, dominating the tournament and displaying elite athletic ability. He is a high risk-high reward player who loves to reverse field on the entire defense. He is a decorated track star who shows obvious explosion every time he touches the ball.","Wilson is extremely explosive and quick-twitched off the snap. He can accelerate to top speed quickly and neutralizes the negative effects of his small frame by lowering his pad level into hits. He is so explosive and generates such movement with his leg drive that he is capable of running over linebackers but prefers to use his agility to make guys miss in space. Wilson is just as electric working as a receiver out of the backfield or in the slot, and its likely he could be used in a variety of alignments early on in his NFL career.","Wilson relied heavily on his athletic ability in college and runs with a very unconventional style that could get him in trouble at the next level against top athletes. He will allow his pad level to get high when changing directions downfield, and he will get caught off guard with that style at the next level. He isn't content enough with a 2-to-3-yard gain and will revert cross-field to try and make a play out of nothing, another habit that simply won't end well in most cases in the NFL.

There are few question marks around the skill set of Pead's game; some may worry about his play transferring to the next level, as he has shown the tendency to disappear at times. But with Pead's natural athletic ability and production at the position, he should be one of the first three backs taken in the draft, with second-round value.","Pead has an initial step out of his stance that is comparable to some of the best backs currently in the league. He hits the hole explosively and gets up to top speed quickly, which allows him to get upfield and find a seam without getting touched. He has good vision once he gets through the hole, and displays the foot quickness and lateral agility to make the first defender miss. But he is careful to stick his foot in the ground and get upfield to pick up yards. He can dance around defenders but prefers to cut once and go.

Although he didn't do it much at Cincinnati, he is likely to catch a lot of passes at the next level. ","Pead isn't a willing blocker and barely displays the strength to stall rushers when he does step in.

He can quickly get to top speed and will accelerate throughout the play; he has deceptive top end speed. He is secure with the football and a good receiving option out of the backfield. Boom is tough and will stick his face in front of rushing linebackers effectively.","Herron has decent ability to run between the tackles.

While he may have benefited from the holes that his Heisman-winning quarterback and top-wide receiver prospect (Kendall  Wright) opened up for him in the run game due to their stellar pass play, Ganaway is a legitimate prospect in his own right. He shows good initial quickness, a burst through the line, and seriously imposing size that give him fourth- or fifth-round value.","Ganaway is a huge back, and he plays that way.

Once to the hole he is good to make a guy miss or run through him, although he doesn't run with the power you'd expect out of a back his size. He is very reliable as a pass catcher and ran a lot of polished routes out of the backfield for RG3. He has the temperament of a special teams player and, given his strong ball security, could play early on, especially in short-yardage situations.","Ganaway is somewhat of a passive player for his size.

He looks natural to sift through defenders that get in the backfield early, and shows a good little burst once breaking through the line. He is a good runner in the open field and has some deceptive juke moves that he will put on bigger players. Ballard carries the ball high and tight and is very conscious of oncoming traffic to be a dependable inside runner. His value early on is that he is a big body who is willing to block oncoming linebackers in pass protection, and is also a good check-down option in the pass game who understands how to work up field and pick up first downs after catching the ball. Ballard is also a willing special teamer who likes to fly around and seeks contact.","Ballard is not a very quick-twitched athlete. He is big, but doesn't run with a ton of power and bigger linebackers often bring him down on first contact. He is instinctual inside and when he has the ball in his hands in the flats, but he does not have the speed to get to the edge on his own.

He carries late-round or free-agent value.","Morris is a bit underdeveloped in his legs despite his frame, but he runs low and can get to the hole with a decent burst. He is a natural runner between the tackles who can feel and avoid pressure or wait for his seam to develop. He is deceptively agile in short areas to avoid clean hits on him through the initial three yards of a play, and he plays much faster when tasked with finding daylight in a short area.

Richardson is durable enough to handle a season full of carries, and with the new CBA rules putting a ceiling on rookie salaries, it will be tough for teams to pass on such a talented, polished back that will be a franchise back for years to come.","Richardson is as compact and coiled an athlete that the running back position has seen since Adrian Peterson. Richardson is explosive, powerful and balanced, the three most shining traits that are evident when he ran the ball for Alabama. He is a heady and instinctual player who is patient enough to wait for blocks to develop within the scheme and quick enough to change course and cut backfield to daylight. Richardson has a strong core that he uses to break arm tackles and get physical leverage under would-be blockers or blitzers in pass protection. He is a true three-down back who can be effective on screens and out of the backfield catching the ball. Richardson is an ideal height, big enough to remain a force in the power run game, yet small enough to remain elusive and hide behind blocks.","Richardson ran behind a very good, experienced offensive line at Alabama. Nick Saban has brought in so much talent, parlayed with a top-notch, NFL savvy coaching staff, that nearly every position has a top draftable athlete honing it. Mark Ingram won the Heisman a year ago as the best player on the best team, and to some Richardson could be an example of a smart, serviceable player running in a talented offense. Richardson will likely prove that he has the talent to make plays on his own, but much of his production were yards on plays in a good scheme with a seam and an opportunity to get to linebacker and safety level without much trouble.

While there is debate about the risk behind investing an early round selection on a back whose shelf life is short, Miller has put together enough solid tape to garner a late first-round value and should continue to excite and ascend as he displays his athletic ability throughout the pre-draft process.","Miller has track speed and actually ran a few anchor legs for the Miami track team prior to his junior year. Once in the open field, he is a threat to take it the distance and is not only a straight-line, long-speed runner; Miller has even more impressive quickness off the snap and in tight areas to avoid and stay productive. He is very smooth and impressive off the snap as he gets to top speed quickly and is able to pick his spots at full speed in a very effective way. He hardly ever gets stuck in the backfield and is reliable to get positive yardage on each carry. He is a very efficient runner who has a natural feel for maneuvering his way through the box. ","Miller has only one full season of tape and was rather ineffective as a runner prior to this year. He relies on speed and leg drive to gain yards.

He has strong athletic ability, with his footwork being his most outstanding trait. He can make people miss in the open field and in tight spaces. He is an effective runner between the tackles and can burst through the lane to take it the distance. What stands out most about Martin is his decisiveness as a ball carrier; he often hits the hole hard. He is a natural with the ball in his hands and will bring value to an NFL team as a special teams player, either as a return option or a contributor in the coverage game.

Unlike Demps, his track-speed translates to the football field, which makes him an intriguing prospect who has played various roles within Florida's offense. While not nearly as big as former teammate Percy Harvin, Rainey has been able to deliver for the Gators in a similar fashion.

He is a good route runner out of the backfield and out of the slot and he will likely get work there early in the pros.",Rainey is undersized and it shows when he tries to run inside or pass protect. He almost always looks to get outside and will go down on contact when running in the box.

He is an effective slasher-type with third- or fourth-round value. He would need to play special teams to make a 53-man roster and has displayed the physicality to do so.","Herron is quick out of his stance to get the ball and make a decision whether to hit the whole, or sink his hips and ignite his explosive lateral step to get outside. He has good vision once through the hole, but is better running outside than through the tackles. He can quickly get to top speed and will accelerate throughout the play; he has deceptive top end speed. He is secure with the football and a good receiving option out of the backfield. Boom is tough and will stick his face in front of rushing linebackers effectively.","Herron has decent ability to run between the tackles.

He is an athletic back who had a tough time staying healthy at Temple, which could be a concern for teams looking to take him in the middle rounds. He has good vision and can cut back across the field when jammed up. He isn't very powerful and likely would excel working within a zone-blocking offense in which he can take one cut and go.

He had an impressive showing against Washington in a bowl game and showed why he is more than just an afterthought to Robert Griffin III in Baylor's offense. While he may have benefited from the holes that his Heisman-winning quarterback and top-wide receiver prospect (Kendall  Wright) opened up for him in the run game due to their stellar pass play, Ganaway is a legitimate prospect in his own right. He shows good initial quickness, a burst through the line, and seriously imposing size that give him fourth- or fifth-round value.","Ganaway is a huge back, and he plays that way. He is very quick out of his stance to hit the hole for such a big back, but he also shows the patience and savvy to let plays develop for him. Once to the hole he is good to make a guy miss or run through him, although he doesn't run with the power you'd expect out of a back his size. He is very reliable as a pass catcher and ran a lot of polished routes out of the backfield for RG3. He has the temperament of a special teams player and, given his strong ball security, could play early on, especially in short-yardage situations.","Ganaway is somewhat of a passive player for his size.

He looks natural to sift through defenders that get in the backfield early, and shows a good little burst once breaking through the line. He is a good runner in the open field and has some deceptive juke moves that he will put on bigger players. Ballard carries the ball high and tight and is very conscious of oncoming traffic to be a dependable inside runner. His value early on is that he is a big body who is willing to block oncoming linebackers in pass protection, and is also a good check-down option in the pass game who understands how to work up field and pick up first downs after catching the ball. Ballard is also a willing special teamer who likes to fly around and seeks contact.","Ballard is not a very quick-twitched athlete. He is big, but doesn't run with a ton of power and bigger linebackers often bring him down on first contact.

He is a natural runner between the tackles who can feel and avoid pressure or wait for his seam to develop. He is deceptively agile in short areas to avoid clean hits on him through the initial three yards of a play, and he plays much faster when tasked with finding daylight in a short area. He has a sense of urgency in the backfield with all that he does. He is capable of blocking in pass protection at the next level if his willingness matches his ability.","Morris doesn't have NFL speed and will need to define himself more as a runner if he wants to make enough of an impression in a camp. He has the natural ability within the tackles to be successful, but at the NFL seams and holes are harder to come by and arm tackles difficult to avoid.

Very good vision, sees cut back lanes, anticipates momentum and blocks, weaves through trash. Likes to use short stiff arms downfield to keep some separation.  Successful pass protector, mostly uses cut blocks. Reliable receiver. Quick initial move after the catch frequently makes the first man miss, especially when trailing.","Torn ACL in 2010. Does not elect for fair catch as a punt returner even with coverage bearing down on him. Always goes for cut block in pass protection instead of attacking face up.

Runs with some lean for his size, and he lowers his pads pre-contact to get an extra yard. Takes big hits and bounces back up. Tight-ropes the sideline when necessary to maximize runs. Shows the ability to create behind the line of scrimmage when the play side breaks down, and the creativity and knowledge of pursuit angles to set up second level defenders. Shows patience running behind pulling guards and fullbacks, can cut in either direction off the block. Stiff-arm in the open field can be effective in keeping away defensive backs. Very dangerous in space. Good hands to be a threat as a receiver in the flat, over the middle, on screens, and down the sideline on wheel routes. Dangerous kick returner who can slide through creases and explode into the open with quick cuts and pure acceleration.","Undersized, and lacks great power as an inside back, though he has some lower-body strength and the effort is there when trying to run clock. Does not possess elite agility to elude defenders in space, and can be brought down by glancing tackle attempts. Cuts are not consistently decisive or strong.

Can make people miss at any level of the field, but doesn't have very good vision. As the season progressed, Bell's lateral agility declined. Bell proved capable of handling a tremendous amount of touches. To become a full-time back though, Bell will need to continue to improve his ability as a pass catcher or become a more consistent blocker, in addition to improving his vision as a runner.","Big, bruising back with power in his lower body but lighter feet than you’d expect give his size. North-south runner effective in one and two-back sets. Strong cuts and a nice burst out of them makes him capable of breaking off big runs when the hole is available. Sets up defenders in the open field to cut away. Flashes some stop-start ability and shake in space that freezes oncoming defenders. Pushes piles with lower body strength. Can lower his pads for contact, churn through tackle attempts to become difficult to bring down due to second and third efforts. Wiggles and pushes through traffic inside to get the extra yard after it looks as though he’s stopped. Possesses a spin move to come off tackles at the second level, maintains balance to keep on moving or at least fall forward for an extra couple of yards. Uses a strong stiff arm in space, as well. Agile enough to jump over defenders trying to cut him down in the open field. Used in Wildcat formation in the red zone. Decent receiver out of the backfield.","Taller back who presents a big target for defenders to hit, especially when failing to lower his pads going into the hole. Size also limits his breakaway speed and ability to create on his own if challenged by better front sevens.Sub par vision prevents him from seeing cut back lines and sees him running up the back of his lead blocker too often. Pass protection form is inconsistent, has size to handle rushers or at least push them around the pocket, but often moves his feet too slowly or tries to cut instead of setting to anchor.

He has a good build for the position, and is a solid downhill type of runner. While Gillislee doesn't have remarkable agility or balance, he works at hitting the holes he's given, and runs with some speed and power. He will likely be a mid-round pick that works in a committee.","Solid runner capable of carrying the load when given the opportunity. Possesses adequate size and power for the position. Sets up cutbacks, sticks his foot in the ground well to avoid penetrating defenders or go against the flow of the line. Has enough speed to break off a big run if the hole is available to him. Displays some vision in the open field, does not head to the sidelines if more yards can be had. Not a finesse runner, keeps his feet moving through contact. Uses his hand to swipe aside tacklers coming inside-out, maintains balance to continue downfield. Willing to lower pads in short-yardage and lean to get the extra yard. Willing in pass pro, can be effective as a cut-blocker and will make contact with blitzers off the edge. Good hands out of the backfield, adjusts to high passes and is a threat to make the first defender miss with a cut after the catch.","Not as decisive as you’d like after the handoff, pausing instead of pressing the line.Will waste steps in moving laterally. Inconsistent taking what the defense gives him, will bounce outside where NFL defenders will bring him down for a loss.

His speed is undeniable, and he can be a weapon catching the ball out of the backfield. However, Barner has numerous concerns, including fumbles, pass protection, and the tendency to try and bounce everything to the outside. In spite of all of this, Barner can still be an extremely dangerous weapon in a running back committee and as a kick returner.","Excellent straight-line speed puts defenders in his dust in the open field.

Eludes penetrating defenders in the holes with a quick sidestep, also has the vision to set up safeties and cut around them for big gains. Weapon out of the backfield, can catch passes with his hands inside his frame and over his shoulder and is tough to track down if hit on the run.","Runs high, and as a result, does not play with tremendous balance. Too often seeks to bounce the ball to the outside and will miss running lanes as a result. Lean build, not much strength in the lower body to power through tackles inside.

","Slasher who uses his foot quickness to find his way through traffic to move the chains. In one-back or two-back sets, can start with the flow then cut back into a running lane, spinning through trash on his way to consistent four or five-yard rushes. His lateral quickness comes into play when penetrating defenders look to corral him; somehow he finds a way to cut left or right to run away from their waiting arms. There’s no questioning his toughness, carries the mail 30 times a game and gives great effort trying to use his good lean to plow through arm tackles for extra yardage. Not used as a receiver very often, but his solid hands, quickness and agility will make him a valued weapon in the passing game. Those hands make him a solid safety valve punt returner, as well, even if he hasn’t yet shown explosiveness in that duty.","Not the most powerful of backs, NFL defenders will stone him at the point of attack more regularly than their college counterparts because of his average lower-body strength. Leggy runner who can look out of control at times, though he usually manages to keep his balance.

In 2010, Davis sparked the Razorbacks with an impressive late-season surge when he led SEC with 1,322 rushing yards, 13 scores. His power and burst in the open field make him tough to stop when all his parts are in working order; but this has proved to be a struggle for Davis.","Big-bodied north-south runner. Has a thick lower-body build and runs with enough forward lean to run through arm tackles. Agile enough to spin off tackles inside and hurdle would-be tacklers in the open field.

He can run with patience, but has the loose hips and agile feet to plant-and-go in a hurry. He sees the field and does a nice job of setting up and eluding tacklers with lateral cuts or stacked moves. While he's confident in space, Evans lacks the commitment and finishing force to make a living inside the tackles.

Gary Brightwell,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gary-brightwell/32004252-4930-6021-4b99-ec388b94f0eb,"One-speed runner relying on size, urgency and toughness to make up for a lack of open-field talent. He can hit the edge and turn the corner on counters and bounce-outs, but gets too impatient to cut runs back. Below-average vision diminishes his ability to get the most out of runs, but his loose lower body makes sharp cuts against the grain a successful weapon for him. He's a tough runner, but lacks creativity and contact balance to stand out against others in this class, despite his traits.

Gerrid Doaks,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/gerrid-doaks/3200444f-4140-0459-f3d8-8ab62922b0eb,"Pro size with broad, thickly built lower half. Doaks can be a physical runner when he wants to be, but there are times when he gears down rather than imposing his will into contact. He lacks foot quickness and the desired field vision to find pathways and yardage on his own, so power will need to become his calling card. He looks more comfortable lining up behind the quarterback and attacking the flanks, where he has longer to process the defense and can get his momentum building. He does just enough out of the backfield and has decent pass pro potential. He might go undrafted but has enough going for him to get a look.
","
Broad lower body with thick legs.
Productivity hurt by inconsistent blocking at times.
Gets his speed up when hitting the outside carry.
Good forward lean and lowered pads as finisher.
Size and strength to pinball off tacklers when he's cranked up.
Improved in 2020 at keeping his feet moving through contact.
Puts pepper into his chip blocks and blitz pickups.

","
Not very quick out of his stance.
Blurry field vision in reading the defensive front.
Lethargic feet slow jump-cuts and lateral movements.
Doesn't show much savvy getting through lanes cleanly.
Won't wiggle enough to elude tacklers.
Fumbling issues need to be corrected.
Pass-catching can be a labor for him.
