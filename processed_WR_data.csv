Justin Blackmon,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-blackmon/3200424c-4128-4263-6be3-495961813b14,Blackmon is an early-out junior who enjoyed a storied and productive career at Oklahoma State. The two time Biletnikoff Award winner as the nation's top receiver filled the role of WR1 nicely after Dez Bryant left for the NFL. Blackmon has proven to be as athletic as Bryant and even more productive. He has elite ability to contribute early in the NFL and should be selected within the top 15 picks and start immediately.,"Blackmon has a nice frame and actually seems taller than he is. He possesses elite jumping ability and can be a jump-ball, red zone threat despite being barely over 6 feet. He has Anquan Boldin-type ability running drive and underneath routes, and can excel from any spot on the field. He would be a severe mismatch working out of the slot, something he did occasionally at OSU. Blackmon is extremely polished in his technique in-phase, and he has an incredible ability to vary his speed to keep defenders off balance. He is slow off the line but is able to release with ease by utilizing both his strength and jab steps. Blackmon is a natural receiver who understands how to read coverages and sit down in zones. He is a very aggressive catcher who literally attacks the ball when it is within his large catching radius, and he has the ability to use his frame to box out defenders. Blackmon can naturally adjust to poorly thrown balls on the run and can bail quarterbacks out of poorly thrown balls.","Blackmon is not as quick off the ball as his athletic ability would suggest. He has good top-end speed and acceleration in the open field, but struggles to burst enough in short areas to separate. He has such an elongated stride as a runner that he has difficulties running sharp routes. Much of his production comes from being a playmaker at the point of the catch and afterwards; he doesn't get himself open through route running. As a blocker, he is an all-or-nothing type who can't recover once whiffing on a block. He will need a lot of work on his technique in this area. Blackmon's stride could stand to be his biggest problem at the next level, as it could be difficult to get open against premier athletes with the amount of gathering and stuttering it takes in his footwork to change directions.",OKLAHOMA STATE,5,WR,Jacksonville Jaguars,2012,"Blackmon is an early-out junior who enjoyed a storied and productive career at Oklahoma State.

Blackmon is extremely polished in his technique in-phase, and he has an incredible ability to vary his speed to keep defenders off balance. He is slow off the line but is able to release with ease by utilizing both his strength and jab steps. Blackmon is a natural receiver who understands how to read coverages and sit down in zones. He is a very aggressive catcher who literally attacks the ball when it is within his large catching radius, and he has the ability to use his frame to box out defenders. Blackmon can naturally adjust to poorly thrown balls on the run and can bail quarterbacks out of poorly thrown balls. Blackmon is not as quick off the ball as his athletic ability would suggest. He has good top-end speed and acceleration in the open field, but struggles to burst enough in short areas to separate. He has such an elongated stride as a runner that he has difficulties running sharp routes. Much of his production comes from being a playmaker at the point of the catch and afterwards; he doesn't get himself open through route running. As a blocker, he is an all-or-nothing type who can't recover once whiffing on a block. He will need a lot of work on his technique in this area. Blackmon's stride could stand to be his biggest problem at the next level, as it could be difficult to get open against premier athletes with the amount of gathering and stuttering it takes in his footwork to change directions.",blackmon_junior junior_enjoyed enjoyed_storied storied_productive productive_career career_oklahoma oklahoma_state blackmon junior enjoyed storied productive career oklahoma state. two_time time_biletnikoff biletnikoff_award award_winner winner_nation nation_top top_receiver receiver_filled filled_role role_wr1 wr1_nicely nicely_dez dez_bryant bryant_left left_nfl two time biletnikoff award winner nation top receiver filled role wr1 nicely dez bryant left nfl. blackmon_proven proven_athletic athletic_bryant bryant_even even_productive blackmon proven athletic bryant even productive. elite_ability ability_contribute contribute_early early_nfl nfl_selected selected_within within_top top_15 15_picks picks_start start_immediately elite ability contribute early nfl selected within top 15 picks start immediately. blackmon_nice nice_frame frame_actually actually_seems seems_taller blackmon nice frame actually seems taller. possesses_elite elite_jumping jumping_ability ability_red red_zone zone_threat threat_despite despite_barely barely_6 6_feet possesses elite jumping ability red zone threat despite barely 6 feet. anquan_ability ability_running running_drive drive_underneath underneath_routes routes_excel excel_spot spot_field anquan ability running drive underneath routes excel spot field. would_severe severe_mismatch mismatch_working working_slot slot_something something_occasionally occasionally_osu would severe mismatch working slot something occasionally osu. blackmon_extremely extremely_polished polished_technique technique_incredible incredible_ability ability_vary vary_speed speed_keep keep_defenders defenders_balance blackmon extremely polished technique incredible ability vary speed keep defenders balance. slow_line line_able able_release release_ease ease_utilizing utilizing_strength strength_jab jab_steps slow line able release ease utilizing strength jab steps. blackmon_natural natural_receiver receiver_understands understands_read read_coverages coverages_sit sit_zones blackmon natural receiver understands read coverages sit zones. aggressive_catcher catcher_literally literally_attacks attacks_ball ball_within within_large large_catching catching_radius radius_ability ability_use use_frame frame_box box_defenders aggressive catcher literally attacks ball within large catching radius ability use frame box defenders. blackmon_naturally naturally_adjust adjust_poorly poorly_thrown thrown_balls balls_run run_bail bail_quarterbacks quarterbacks_poorly poorly_thrown thrown_balls blackmon naturally adjust poorly thrown balls run bail quarterbacks poorly thrown balls. blackmon_quick quick_ball ball_athletic athletic_ability ability_would would_suggest blackmon quick ball athletic ability would suggest. good_speed speed_acceleration acceleration_open open_field field_struggles struggles_burst burst_enough enough_short short_areas areas_separate good speed acceleration open field struggles burst enough short areas separate. elongated_stride stride_runner runner_difficulties difficulties_running running_sharp sharp_routes elongated stride runner difficulties running sharp routes. much_production production_comes comes_playmaker playmaker_point point_catch catch_afterwards afterwards_get get_open open_route route_running much production comes playmaker point catch afterwards get open route running. blocker_type type_ca ca_recover recover_whiffing whiffing_block blocker type ca recover whiffing block. need_lot lot_work work_technique technique_area need lot work technique area. blackmon_stride stride_could could_stand stand_biggest biggest_problem problem_next next_level level_could could_difficult difficult_get get_open open_premier premier_athletes athletes_amount amount_gathering gathering_stuttering stuttering_takes takes_footwork footwork_change change_directions blackmon stride could stand biggest problem next level could difficult get open premier athletes amount gathering stuttering takes footwork change directions. ,0.95,0.1356829573934837,0.05,0.0,0,0

Ryan Broyles,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ryan-broyles/32004252-4f82-9985-b2f1-15fafef1125c,"Polished is one word that could be used to describe Broyles and the consistent production he has turned in at the collegiate level. Though undersized, Broyles understands route concepts and how to get open and secure the ball. His ball skills and route-running ability alone could allow him to start at the next level very quickly. His feel for space on the field and overall ability to understand defenses boost his productivity immensely, because even though he displays premier athletic ability, he certainly doesn't make many plays due to his size.

He false steps often at the snap and has a below-average burst off the line, and although he uses his length well to avoid press, could have issues once teams start to get in his face at the line of scrimmage.

Has outstanding body composure and an effortless stride. Electrifying foot quickness. Game-breaking speed with necessary feel of a downfield receiver. Tracks the throw over his shoulder and never breaks stride in the chase. Averaged 28.2 yards per catch and 54.5 percent of his catches were for 25-plus yards in 2014. Used outside and from slot.

Shows some aggressiveness as run blocker and gives effort when working up to safeties. Hands are inconsistent and don't appear to be strong enough to consistently succeed on contested catches. Showed some focus issues when routes worked towards the middle. Average foot quickness from press release. Play speed is consistent, but doesn't have an extra gear. Needs to do a better job of selling the deep route to back cornerbacks off. Acceleration from breaks is average. Film shows potential concern getting away from press cleanly. Doesn't win enough near the end zone. Gaudy stats took a big hit against upper-­echelon competition.

Saw increase in targets and responded with improved production. In 2016, had at least one catch of at least 30 yards in eight of first nine games, outplaying highly regarded teammate Jehu Chesson. Fluid working two-way releases from slot. Smooth transitions in his routes. Won't give away plant-and-go cuts to the post, allowing him to stay ahead of the cornerback. Heady player. Adjusts routes to create better throwing opportunities for quarterbacks. Accepts responsibility as blocker climbing up to cornerbacks with some urgency of engagement. Able to sustain his block when run play flows his way. Locks up back-side safety blocks. Build-up runner who is slow to eat up cornerback cushion. Play speed appears to be average. Missing suddenness and twitch. Inconsistent release quickness against press. Could struggle to uncover against aggressive man coverage. Gradual sink into breaks alerts cornerbacks to slam on breaks and challenge the throw. Body catcher. Ball will beat him up and he suffers from focus drops. Needs to improve positioning against defensive backs. Rarely escapes a spirited tackle attempt. Not very dynamic after the catch.

Arcega-Whiteside plays with functional quickness in spurts, but not enough to get away from tight coverage and he won't run by many NFL cornerbacks on go routes. However, his basketball bloodlines are on full display every time the ball is in the air, using his body control and ball skills to excel at combat catches and back-shoulder throws. Arcega-Whiteside may not be explosive, but his competitive nature should help make him a future NFL starter. Imposing combination of height, weight and play strength. Steady climbs in production each season. Plays strong inside the route. Hits accelerator when he gets defender leaning in the route. Savage in the red zone with his post skills on display. Puts cornerbacks on his hip and keeps them there. Balances on defender with burly frame and waits to make ball adjustment. Above-average ball-tracking and timing to go get it. Catches with sudden, strong hands. Carves out space and finishes combat catches. Able to drop low and dig out grass burners. Able to bull through tacklers for additional yards after catch. Highly confident field demeanor.

Size and strength for all blocking duties. Smooth burst at stem to gain ground on post routes. Skilled ball tracker deep. Double moves feature fluid stop-start.  Excessive stutter-steps against soft press positioning. Doesn't have threatening initial surge into routes. Tight hips limit quickness into breaks. Could struggle to find operating room as a pro. Schemed into multiple one-on-one looks downfield. Needs to get shoulders squared to throws to protect catch space. Below-average talent after the catch. Ran limited route tree.

However, Chase is supremely talented as a ball winner and playmaker. After all, routes and release can be coached. He had some issues when Trevon Diggs and Cameron Dantzler gave hard jams to his release in 2019, so that will need to be addressed. His burst is effortless, which tends to catch coverage off guard when he really hits the vertical gas. His competitive nature and play strength simply act as multipliers for his outstanding ball skills. He hasn't played football since very early in 2020 and still has work to do, but he should be an early starter and a future Pro Bowler.

Terrace Marshall Jr.,https://www.nfl.com/prospects/terrace-marshall-jr/32004d41-5248-2288-c0d9-2d0813ce7c88,"Big, fast and talented, Marshall has the ingredients to become a solid starter in the league but has some questions to answer. With the departure of Justin Jefferson and with Ja'Marr Chase opting out, more targets and more shaded coverage ended up coming his way until he opted out at the end of November. He looks much more comfortable outside than he does in the slot, and he's a more reliable ball-catcher when he's working the second and third levels. He's a natural ball-tracker with a second gear and the catch radius to go get it, and his size gives him an advantage on 50-50 balls. For all of his talent, Marshall seemed disinterested at times in 2020 and wasn't always committed to finishing his routes or running them with consistent intensity. There are traits and talent at his disposal, but the difference between becoming a WR2 and a WR3/4 could be determined by how hard he's willing to work at his craft.

",LSU,59,WR,Carolina Panthers,2021,"Big, fast and talented, Marshall has the ingredients to become a solid starter in the league but has some questions to answer. With the departure of Justin Jefferson and with Ja'Marr Chase opting out, more targets and more shaded coverage ended up coming his way until he opted out at the end of November. He looks much more comfortable outside than he does in the slot, and he's a more reliable ball-catcher when he's working the second and third levels. He's a natural ball-tracker with a second gear and the catch radius to go get it, and his size gives him an advantage on 50-50 balls. For all of his talent, Marshall seemed disinterested at times in 2020 and wasn't always committed to finishing his routes or running them with consistent intensity. There are traits and talent at his disposal, but the difference between becoming a WR2 and a WR3/4 could be determined by how hard he's willing to work at his craft.
 
Expected to be a big-time tester.
Exciting height, weight, speed combination.
Averaged over 104.4 yards per game in 2020.
Playmaker who averaged a touchdown every four catches over last two years.
Size to bang on undersized corners down the field.
Strides and separates on go routes.
Quality ball-tracker with second gear to chase it down.
Foot quickness is a plus for being a tall wideout.
Consistently gains ground on coverage on inside routes.
Has experience outside and as a big slot in LSU offense.
Very wide catch radius.
Able to rescue throws way outside his frame.
Runs with decent toughness after the catch.

 
Appeared to lack focus and intensity in some 2020 games.
Excellent timed speed but doesn't always play fast.
Too content in allowing press corners to attack his release.
Uses same stutter-skip setups into stems and breaks underneath.
Fails to crank up quality route fakes to tilt cornerbacks off balance.
Had focus drops in 2020.
A step slow to get hands catch-ready as slot target.
Allows coverage to crowd him too often.
Needs to do a better job of finishing his routes.

However, the more tape you watch of Palmer, the more you like him. He has size, clearly works on refining his route-running and has a good understanding of how to help himself with contested catches. While he doesn't appear to have great long speed, he did beat future NFL cornerbacks at Georgia (DJ Daniel) and Alabama (Patrick Surtain Jr.) down the field for scores. He's an instinctive pass catcher on all three levels with above-average ball skills, but beating press and finding separation will be his toughest challenges in the NFL. The limited production is a concern, but he appears to have the traits of a solid NFL backup.

",TENNESSEE,78,WR,Los Angeles Chargers,2021,"While he was hurt by inconsistent quarterbacking during his time at Tennessee, the production totals are still disappointing. However, the more tape you watch of Palmer, the more you like him. He has size, clearly works on refining his route-running and has a good understanding of how to help himself with contested catches. While he doesn't appear to have great long speed, he did beat future NFL cornerbacks at Georgia (DJ Daniel) and Alabama (Patrick Surtain Jr.) down the field for scores. He's an instinctive pass catcher on all three levels with above-average ball skills, but beating press and finding separation will be his toughest challenges in the NFL. The limited production is a concern, but he appears to have the traits of a solid NFL backup.
 
Nearly 70 percent of his catches went for a first down.
Uses pad and hip sink for quicker breaks.
Will give what he gets against physical corners inside route.
Comes out of turns with tight angles.
Partitions defender away from the catch point.
Catches the point of the football with adequate hand extension.
Works to maintain field leverage for bucket throws to the boundary.
Has ball-tracking and body control of an NFL wideout.
Graceful and fluid in mid-air.
Settles into favorable angles for his quarterback versus zone.

",WESTERN MICHIGAN,56,WR,Seattle Seahawks,2021,"He's not a great route-runner, will struggle with contested catches and lacks desired size, but he can really fly and has home run potential from anywhere on the field. Eskridge is a linear route-runner with good tempo when working down the field but will need a more limited route tree featuring crossing routes, slants, posts and over routes so he can rely on his speed rather than route-running. He can rise up and get the tall throws but catching through contact is where he is likely to struggle. He has gadget potential in the quick game and is a potentially dangerous kick returner, but his biggest selling point might be as a field stretcher from the slot.

Possesses desired blend of size and speed.
Rises to the occasion in the biggest games.
Vertical speed fueled by a strong second gear.
Strides to separation when working across the field.
Hip bend to brake hard and open to quarterback quickly.
Twitchy plant and burst to uncover cleanly underneath.
Catch-and-run talent to turn short throws into chunk plays.

 
Fails to stack and control defender’s chase tempo.
Doesn’t extend and catch away from his body.
Unconvincing drive phase for intermediate routes.
Underdeveloped catch technique causes drops.
Doesn’t snap routes off with much precision.
